Epilogue

Foreword

One of our favorite candies here in Denmark is Ga-Jol, whose strong
licorice vapors are a perfect complement to our damp and often chilly
weather. Part of the charm of Ga-Jol to us Danes is the wise or witty
sayings printed on the flap of every box top. I bought a two-pack of the
delicacy this morning and found that it bore this old Danish saw:

�rlighed i sm� ting er ikke nogen lille ting.

"Honesty in small things is not a small thing." It was a good omen
consistent with what I already wanted to say here. Small things matter. This
is a book about humble concerns whose value is nonetheless far from small.

God is in the details, said the architect Ludwig mies van der Rohe. This
quote recalls contemporary arguments about the role of architecture in
software development, and particularly in the Agile world. Bob and I
occasionally find ourselves passionately engaged in this dialogue. And yes,
mies van der Rohe was attentive to utility and to the timeless forms of
building that underlie great architecture. On the other hand, he also
personally selected every doorknob for every house he designed. Why?
Because small things matter.

In our ongoing "debate" on TDD, Bob and I have discovered that we agree
that software architecture has an important place in development, though
we likely have different visions of exactly what that means. Such quibbles
are relatively unimportant, however, because we can accept for granted that
responsible professionals give some time to thinking and planning at the
outset of a project. The late-1990s notions of design driven only by the tests
and the code are long gone. Yet attentiveness to detail is an even more
critical foundation of professionalism than is any grand vision. First, it is
through practice in the small that professionals gain proficiency and trust
for practice in the large. Second, the smallest bit of sloppy construction, of
the door that does not close tightly or the slightly crooked tile on the floor,
or even the messy desk, completely dispels the charm of the larger whole.
That is what clean code is about.

Still, architecture is just one metaphor for software development, and in
particular for that part of software that delivers the initial product in the
same sense that an architect delivers a pristine building. In these days of
Scrum and Agile, the focus is on quickly bringing product to market. We
want the factory running at top speed to produce software. These are human
factories: thinking, feeling coders who are working from a product backlog
or user story to create product. The manufacturing metaphor looms ever
strong in such thinking. The production aspects of Japanese auto
manufacturing, of an assembly-line world, inspire much of Scrum.

Yet even in the auto industry, the bulk of the work lies not in manufacturing
but in maintenance--or its avoidance. In software, 80% or more of what we
do is quaintly called "maintenance": the act of repair. Rather than
embracing the typical Western focus on producing good software, we
should be thinking more like home repairmen in the building industry, or
auto mechanics in the automotive field. What does Japanese management
have to say about that?

In about 1951, a quality approach called Total Productive Maintenance
(TPM) came on the Japanese scene. Its focus is on maintenance rather than
on production. One of the major pillars of TPM is the set of so-called 5S
principles. 5S is a set of disciplines--and here I use the term "discipline"
instructively. These 5S principles are in fact at the foundations of Lean--
another buzzword on the Western scene, and an increasingly prominent
buzzword in software circles. These principles are not an option. As Uncle
Bob relates in his front matter, good software practice requires such
discipline: focus, presence of mind, and thinking. It is not always just about
doing, about pushing the factory equipment to produce at the optimal
velocity. The 5S philosophy comprises these concepts:

   � Seiri, or organization (think "sort" in English). Knowing where things
      are--using approaches such as suitable naming--is crucial. You think
      naming identifiers isn't important? Read on in the following chapters.

   � Seiton, or tidiness (think "systematize" in English). There is an old
      American saying: A place for everything, and everything in its place.
      A piece of code should be where you expect to find it--and, if not, you
      should re-factor to get it there.

   � Seiso, or cleaning (think "shine" in English): Keep the workplace free
      of hanging wires, grease, scraps, and waste. What do the authors here
      say about littering your code with comments and commented-out code
      lines that capture history or wishes for the future? Get rid of them.

   � Seiketsu, or standardization: The group agrees about how to keep the
      workplace clean. Do you think this book says anything about having a
      consistent coding style and set of practices within the group? Where do
      those standards come from? Read on.

   � Shutsuke, or discipline (self-discipline). This means having the
      discipline to follow the practices and to frequently reflect on one's
      work and be willing to change.

If you take up the challenge--yes, the challenge--of reading and applying
this book, you'll come to understand and appreciate the last point. Here, we
are finally driving to the roots of responsible professionalism in a
profession that should be concerned with the life cycle of a product. As we
maintain automobiles and other machines under TPM, breakdown
maintenance--waiting for bugs to surface--is the exception. Instead, we go
up a level: inspect the machines every day and fix wearing parts before they
break, or do the equivalent of the proverbial 10,000-mile oil change to
forestall wear and tear. In code, refactor mercilessly. You can improve yet
one level further, as the TPM movement innovated over 50 years ago: build
machines that are more maintainable in the first place. Making your code
readable is as important as making it executable. The ultimate practice,
introduced in TPM circles around 1960, is to focus on introducing entire
new machines or replacing old ones. As Fred Brooks admonishes us, we
should probably re-do major software chunks from scratch every seven
years or so to sweep away creeping cruft. Perhaps we should update
Brooks' time constant to an order of weeks, days or hours instead of years.
That's where detail lies.

There is great power in detail, yet there is something humble and profound
about this approach to life, as we might stereotypically expect from any
approach that claims Japanese roots. But this is not only an Eastern outlook
on life; English and American folk wisdom are full of such admonishments.
The Seiton quote from above flowed from the pen of an Ohio minister who
literally viewed neatness "as a remedy for every degree of evil." How about
Seiso? Cleanliness is next to godliness. As beautiful as a house is, a messy
desk robs it of its splendor. How about Shutsuke in these small matters? He
who is faithful in little is faithful in much. How about being eager to refactor at the responsible time, strengthening one's position for subsequent
"big" decisions, rather than putting it off? A stitch in time saves nine. The
early bird catches the worm. Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do
today. (Such was the original sense of the phrase "the last responsible
moment" in Lean until it fell into the hands of software consultants.) How
about calibrating the place of small, individual efforts in a grand whole?
Mighty oaks from little acorns grow. Or how about integrating simple
preventive work into everyday life? An ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure. An apple a day keeps the doctor away. Clean code honors
the deep roots of wisdom beneath our broader culture, or our culture as it
once was, or should be, and can be with attentiveness to detail.

Even in the grand architectural literature we find saws that hark back to
these supposed details. Think of mies van der Rohe's doorknobs. That's
seiri. That's being attentive to every variable name. You should name a
variable using the same care with which you name a first-born child.

As every homeowner knows, such care and ongoing refinement never come
to an end. The architect Christopher Alexander--father of patterns and
pattern languages--views every act of design itself as a small, local act of
repair. And he views the craftsmanship of fine structure to be the sole
purview of the architect; the larger forms can be left to patterns and their
application by the inhabitants. Design is ever ongoing not only as we add a
new room to a house, but as we are attentive to repainting, replacing worn
carpets, or upgrading the kitchen sink. Most arts echo analogous sentiments.
In our search for others who ascribe God's home as being in the details, we
find ourselves in the good company of the 19th century French author
Gustav Flaubert. The French poet Paul Valery advises us that a poem is
never done and bears continual rework, and to stop working on it is
abandonment. Such preoccupation with detail is common to all endeavors
of excellence. So maybe there is little new here, but in reading this book
you will be challenged to take up good disciplines that you long ago
surrendered to apathy or a desire for spontaneity and just "responding to
change."

Unfortunately, we usually don't view such concerns as key cornerstones of
the art of programming. We abandon our code early, not because it is done,
but because our value system focuses more on outward appearance than on
the substance of what we deliver. This inattentiveness costs us in the end: A
bad penny always shows up. Research, neither in industry nor in academia,
humbles itself to the lowly station of keeping code clean. Back in my days
working in the Bell Labs Software Production Research organization
(Production, indeed!) we had some back-of-the-envelope findings that
suggested that consistent indentation style was one of the most statistically
significant indicators of low bug density. We want it to be that architecture
or programming language or some other high notion should be the cause of
quality; as people whose supposed professionalism owes to the mastery of
tools and lofty design methods, we feel insulted by the value that those
factory-floor machines, the coders, add through the simple consistent
application of an indentation style. To quote my own book of 17 years ago,
such style distinguishes excellence from mere competence. The Japanese
worldview understands the crucial value of the everyday worker and, more
so, of the systems of development that owe to the simple, everyday actions
of those workers. Quality is the result of a million selfless acts of care--not
just of any great method that descends from the heavens. That these acts are
simple doesn't mean that they are simplistic, and it hardly means that they
are easy. They are nonetheless the fabric of greatness and, more so, of
beauty, in any human endeavor. To ignore them is not yet to be fully human.

Of course, I am still an advocate of thinking at broader scope, and
particularly of the value of architectural approaches rooted in deep domain
knowledge and software usability. The book isn't about that--or, at least, it
isn't obviously about that. This book has a subtler message whose
profoundness should not be underappreciated. It fits with the current saw of
the really code-based people like Peter Sommerlad, Kevlin Henney and
Giovanni Asproni. "The code is the design" and "Simple code" are their
mantras. While we must take care to remember that the interface is the
program, and that its structures have much to say about our program
structure, it is crucial to continuously adopt the humble stance that the
design lives in the code. And while rework in the manufacturing metaphor
leads to cost, rework in design leads to value. We should view our code as
the beautiful articulation of noble efforts of design--design as a process,
not a static endpoint. It's in the code that the architectural metrics of
coupling and cohesion play out. If you listen to Larry Constantine describe
coupling and cohesion, he speaks in terms of code--not lofty abstract
concepts that one might find in UML. Richard Gabriel advises us in his
essay, "Abstraction Descant" that abstraction is evil. Code is anti-evil, and
clean code is perhaps divine.

Going back to my little box of Ga-Jol, I think it's important to note that the
Danish wisdom advises us not just to pay attention to small things, but also
to be honest in small things. This means being honest to the code, honest to
our colleagues about the state of our code and, most of all, being honest
with ourselves about our code. Did we Do our Best to "leave the
campground cleaner than we found it"? Did we re-factor our code before
checking in? These are not peripheral concerns but concerns that lie
squarely in the center of Agile values. It is a recommended practice in
Scrum that re-factoring be part of the concept of "Done." Neither
architecture nor clean code insist on perfection, only on honesty and doing
the best we can. To err is human; to forgive, divine. In Scrum, we make
everything visible. We air our dirty laundry. We are honest about the state of
our code because code is never perfect. We become more fully human,
more worthy of the divine, and closer to that greatness in the details.

In our profession, we desperately need all the help we can get. If a clean
shop floor reduces accidents, and well-organized shop tools increase
productivity, then I'm all for them. As for this book, it is the best pragmatic
application of Lean principles to software I have ever seen in print. I
expected no less from this practical little group of thinking individuals that
has been striving together for years not only to become better, but also to
gift their knowledge to the industry in works such as you now find in your
hands. It leaves the world a little better than I found it before Uncle Bob
sent me the manuscript.

Having completed this exercise in lofty insights, I am off to clean my desk.

Introduction

Which door represents your code? Which door represents your team or your
company? Why are we in that room? Is this just a normal code review or
have we found a stream of horrible problems shortly after going live? Are
we debugging in a panic, poring over code that we thought worked? Are
customers leaving in droves and managers breathing down our necks? How
can we make sure we wind up behind the right door when the going gets
tough? The answer is: craftsmanship.
There are two parts to learning craftsmanship: knowledge and work. You
must gain the knowledge of principles, patterns, practices, and heuristics
that a craftsman knows, and you must also grind that knowledge into your
fingers, eyes, and gut by working hard and practicing.

I can teach you the physics of riding a bicycle. Indeed, the classical
mathematics is relatively straightforward. Gravity, friction, angular
momentum, center of mass, and so forth, can be demonstrated with less
than a page full of equations. Given those formulae I could prove to you
that bicycle riding is practical and give you all the knowledge you needed to
make it work. And you'd still fall down the first time you climbed on that
bike.

Coding is no different. We could write down all the "feel good" principles
of clean code and then trust you to do the work (in other words, let you fall
down when you get on the bike), but then what kind of teachers would that
make us, and what kind of student would that make you?

No. That's not the way this book is going to work.

Learning to write clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the
knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must
practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. You must watch others practice
it and fail. You must see them stumble and retrace their steps. You must see
them agonize over decisions and see the price they pay for making those
decisions the wrong way.

Be prepared to work hard while reading this book. This is not a "feel good"
book that you can read on an airplane and finish before you land. This book
will make you work, and work hard. What kind of work will you be doing?
You'll be reading code--lots of code. And you will be challenged to think
about what's right about that code and what's wrong with it. You'll be asked
to follow along as we take modules apart and put them back together again.
This will take time and effort; but we think it will be worth it.

We have divided this book into three parts. The first several chapters
describe the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. There
is quite a bit of code in these chapters, and they will be challenging to read.
They'll prepare you for the second section to come. If you put the book
down after reading the first section, good luck to you!
The second part of the book is the harder work. It consists of several case
studies of ever-increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in
cleaning up some code--of transforming code that has some problems into
code that has fewer problems. The detail in this section is intense. You will
have to flip back and forth between the narrative and the code listings. You
will have to analyze and understand the code we are working with and walk
through our reasoning for making each change we make. Set aside some
time because this should take you days.

The third part of this book is the payoff. It is a single chapter containing a
list of heuristics and smells gathered while creating the case studies. As we
walked through and cleaned up the code in the case studies, we documented
every reason for our actions as a heuristic or smell. We tried to understand
our own reactions to the code we were reading and changing, and worked
hard to capture why we felt what we felt and did what we did. The result is
a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and
clean code.

This knowledge base is of limited value if you don't do the work of
carefully reading through the case studies in the second part of this book. In
those case studies we have carefully annotated each change we made with
forward references to the heuristics. These forward references appear in
square brackets like this: [H22]. This lets you see the context in which those
heuristics were applied and written! It is not the heuristics themselves that
are so valuable, it is the relationship between those heuristics and the
discrete decisions we made while cleaning up the code in the case studies.

To further help you with those relationships, we have placed a crossreference at the end of the book that shows the page number for every
forward reference. You can use it to look up each place where a certain
heuristic was applied.

If you read the first and third sections and skip over the case studies, then
you will have read yet another "feel good" book about writing good
software. But if you take the time to work through the case studies,
following every tiny step, every minute decision--if you put yourself in our
place, and force yourself to think along the same paths that we thought, then
you will gain a much richer understanding of those principles, patterns,
practices, and heuristics. They won't be "feel good" knowledge any more.
They'll have been ground into your gut, fingers, and heart. They'll have
become part of you in the same way that a bicycle becomes an extension of
your will when you have mastered how to ride it.

On the Cover

The image on the cover is M104: The Sombrero Galaxy. M104 is located in
Virgo and is just under 30 million light-years from us. At its core is a
supermassive black hole weighing in at about a billion solar masses.

Does the image remind you of the explosion of the Klingon power moon
Praxis? I vividly remember the scene in Star Trek VI that showed an
equatorial ring of debris flying away from that explosion. Since that scene,
the equatorial ring has been a common artifact in sci-fi movie explosions. It
was even added to the explosion of Alderaan in later editions of the first
Star Wars movie.

What caused this ring to form around M104? Why does it have such a huge
central bulge and such a bright and tiny nucleus? It looks to me as though
the central black hole lost its cool and blew a 30,000 light-year hole in the
middle of the galaxy. Woe befell any civilizations that might have been in
the path of that cosmic disruption.

Supermassive black holes swallow whole stars for lunch, converting a
sizeable fraction of their mass to energy. E = MC2 is leverage enough, but
when M is a stellar mass: Look out! How many stars fell headlong into that
maw before the monster was satiated? Could the size of the central void be
a hint?

The image of M104 on the cover is a combination of the famous visible
light photograph from Hubble (right), and the recent infrared image from
the Spitzer orbiting observatory (below, right). It's the infrared image that
clearly shows us the ring nature of the galaxy. In visible light we only see
the front edge of the ring in silhouette. The central bulge obscures the rest
of the ring.

But in the infrared, the hot particles in the ring shine through the central
bulge. The two images combined give us a view we've not seen before and
imply that long ago it was a raging inferno of activity.

Clean Code

You are reading this book for two reasons. First, you are a programmer.
Second, you want to be a better programmer. Good. We need better
programmers.
This is a book about good programming. It is filled with code. We are going
to look at code from every different direction. We'll look down at it from
the top, up at it from the bottom, and through it from the inside out. By the
time we are done, we're going to know a lot about code. What's more, we'll
be able to tell the difference between good code and bad code. We'll know
how to write good code. And we'll know how to transform bad code into
good code.
There Will Be Code

One might argue that a book about code is somehow behind the times--that
code is no longer the issue; that we should be concerned about models and
requirements instead. Indeed some have suggested that we are close to the
end of code. That soon all code will be generated instead of written. That
programmers simply won't be needed because business people will
generate programs from specifications.

Nonsense! We will never be rid of code, because code represents the details
of the requirements. At some level those details cannot be ignored or
abstracted; they have to be specified. And specifying requirements in such
detail that a machine can execute them is programming. Such a
specification is code.

I expect that the level of abstraction of our languages will continue to
increase. I also expect that the number of domain-specific languages will
continue to grow. This will be a good thing. But it will not eliminate code.
Indeed, all the specifications written in these higher level and domainspecific language will be code! It will still need to be rigorous, accurate,
and so formal and detailed that a machine can understand and execute it.

The folks who think that code will one day disappear are like
mathematicians who hope one day to discover a mathematics that does not
have to be formal. They are hoping that one day we will discover a way to
create machines that can do what we want rather than what we say. These
machines will have to be able to understand us so well that they can
translate vaguely specified needs into perfectly executing programs that
precisely meet those needs.

This will never happen. Not even humans, with all their intuition and
creativity, have been able to create successful systems from the vague
feelings of their customers. Indeed, if the discipline of requirements
specification has taught us anything, it is that well-specified requirements
are as formal as code and can act as executable tests of that code!

Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express
the requirements. We may create languages that are closer to the
requirements. We may create tools that help us parse and assemble those
requirements into formal structures. But we will never eliminate necessary
precision--so there will always be code.
Bad Code

I was recently reading the preface to Kent Beck's book Implementation
Patterns.1 He says, "... this book is based on a rather fragile premise: that
good code matters...." A fragile premise? I disagree! I think that premise is
one of the most robust, supported, and overloaded of all the premises in our
craft (and I think Kent knows it). We know good code matters because
we've had to deal for so long with its lack.

I know of one company that, in the late 80s, wrote a killer app. It was very
popular, and lots of professionals bought and used it. But then the release
cycles began to stretch. Bugs were not repaired from one release to the next.
Load times grew and crashes increased. I remember the day I shut the
product down in frustration and never used it again. The company went out
of business a short time after that.
Two decades later I met one of the early employees of that company and
asked him what had happened. The answer confirmed my fears. They had
rushed the product to market and had made a huge mess in the code. As
they added more and more features, the code got worse and worse until they
simply could not manage it any longer. It was the bad code that brought the
company down.

Have you ever been significantly impeded by bad code? If you are a
programmer of any experience then you've felt this impediment many
times. Indeed, we have a name for it. We call it wading. We wade through
bad code. We slog through a morass of tangled brambles and hidden
pitfalls. We struggle to find our way, hoping for some hint, some clue, of
what is going on; but all we see is more and more senseless code.

Of course you have been impeded by bad code. So then--why did you
write it?

Were you trying to go fast? Were you in a rush? Probably so. Perhaps you
felt that you didn't have time to do a good job; that your boss would be
angry with you if you took the time to clean up your code. Perhaps you
were just tired of working on this program and wanted it to be over. Or
maybe you looked at the backlog of other stuff that you had promised to get
done and realized that you needed to slam this module together so you
could move on to the next. We've all done it.

We've all looked at the mess we've just made and then have chosen to leave
it for another day. We've all felt the relief of seeing our messy program
work and deciding that a working mess is better than nothing. We've all
said we'd go back and clean it up later. Of course, in those days we didn't
know LeBlanc's law: Later equals never.
The Total Cost of Owning a Mess

If you have been a programmer for longer than two or three years, you have
probably been slowed down by messy code. The degree of the slowdown
can be significant. Over the span of a year or two, teams that were moving
very fast at the beginning of a project can find themselves moving at a
snail's pace. Every change they make to the code breaks two or three other
parts of the code. No change is trivial. Every addition or modification to the
system requires that the tangles, twists, and knots be "understood" so that
more tangles, twists, and knots can be added. Over time the mess becomes
so big and so deep and so tall, they can not clean it up. There is no way at
all.

As the mess builds, the productivity of the team continues to decrease,
asymptotically approaching zero. As productivity decreases, management
does the only thing they can; they add more staff to the project in hopes of
increasing productivity. But that new staff is not versed in the design of the
system. They don't know the difference between a change that matches the
design intent and a change that thwarts the design intent. Furthermore, they,
and everyone else on the team, are under horrific pressure to increase
productivity. So they all make more and more messes, driving the
productivity ever further toward zero. (See Figure 1-1.)

Figure 1-1 Productivity vs. time
The Grand Redesign in the Sky

Eventually the team rebels. They inform management that they cannot
continue to develop in this odious code base. They demand a redesign.
Management does not want to expend the resources on a whole new
redesign of the project, but they cannot deny that productivity is terrible.
Eventually they bend to the demands of the developers and authorize the
grand redesign in the sky.

A new tiger team is selected. Everyone wants to be on this team because it's
a green-field project. They get to start over and create something truly
beautiful. But only the best and brightest are chosen for the tiger team.
Everyone else must continue to maintain the current system.

Now the two teams are in a race. The tiger team must build a new system
that does everything that the old system does. Not only that, they have to
keep up with the changes that are continuously being made to the old
system. Management will not replace the old system until the new system
can do everything that the old system does.

This race can go on for a very long time. I've seen it take 10 years. And by
the time it's done, the original members of the tiger team are long gone, and
the current members are demanding that the new system be redesigned
because it's such a mess.

If you have experienced even one small part of the story I just told, then
you already know that spending time keeping your code clean is not just
cost effective; it's a matter of professional survival.

Attitude

Have you ever waded through a mess so grave that it took weeks to do what
should have taken hours? Have you seen what should have been a one-line
change, made instead in hundreds of different modules? These symptoms
are all too common.

Why does this happen to code? Why does good code rot so quickly into bad
code? We have lots of explanations for it. We complain that the
requirements changed in ways that thwart the original design. We bemoan
the schedules that were too tight to do things right. We blather about stupid
managers and intolerant customers and useless marketing types and
telephone sanitizers. But the fault, dear Dilbert, is not in our stars, but in
ourselves. We are unprofessional.

This may be a bitter pill to swallow. How could this mess be our fault?
What about the requirements? What about the schedule? What about the
stupid managers and the useless marketing types? Don't they bear some of
the blame?

No. The managers and marketers look to us for the information they need to
make promises and commitments; and even when they don't look to us, we
should not be shy about telling them what we think. The users look to us to
validate the way the requirements will fit into the system. The project
managers look to us to help work out the schedule. We are deeply complicit
in the planning of the project and share a great deal of the responsibility for
any failures; especially if those failures have to do with bad code!

"But wait!" you say. "If I don't do what my manager says, I'll be fired."
Probably not. Most managers want the truth, even when they don't act like
it. Most managers want good code, even when they are obsessing about the
schedule. They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion; but
that's their job. It's your job to defend the code with equal passion.

To drive this point home, what if you were a doctor and had a patient who
demanded that you stop all the silly hand-washing in preparation for
surgery because it was taking too much time?2 Clearly the patient is the
boss; and yet the doctor should absolutely refuse to comply. Why? Because
the doctor knows more than the patient about the risks of disease and
infection. It would be unprofessional (never mind criminal) for the doctor to
comply with the patient.

2. When hand-washing was first recommended to physicians by Ignaz Semmelweis in 1847, it was
rejected on the basis that doctors were too busy and wouldn't have time to wash their hands between
patient visits.

So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers
who don't understand the risks of making messes.

The Primal Conundrum

Programmers face a conundrum of basic values. All developers with more
than a few years experience know that previous messes slow them down.
And yet all developers feel the pressure to make messes in order to meet
deadlines. In short, they don't take the time to go fast!

True professionals know that the second part of the conundrum is wrong.
You will not make the deadline by making the mess. Indeed, the mess will
slow you down instantly, and will force you to miss the deadline. The only
way to make the deadline--the only way to go fast--is to keep the code as
clean as possible at all times.

The Art of Clean Code?

Let's say you believe that messy code is a significant impediment. Let's say
that you accept that the only way to go fast is to keep your code clean. Then
you must ask yourself: "How do I write clean code?" It's no good trying to
write clean code if you don't know what it means for code to be clean!

The bad news is that writing clean code is a lot like painting a picture. Most
of us know when a picture is painted well or badly. But being able to
recognize good art from bad does not mean that we know how to paint. So
too being able to recognize clean code from dirty code does not mean that
we know how to write clean code!

Writing clean code requires the disciplined use of a myriad little techniques
applied through a painstakingly acquired sense of "cleanliness." This
"code-sense" is the key. Some of us are born with it. Some of us have to
fight to acquire it. Not only does it let us see whether code is good or bad,
but it also shows us the strategy for applying our discipline to transform bad
code into clean code.

A programmer without "code-sense" can look at a messy module and
recognize the mess but will have no idea what to do about it. A programmer
with "code-sense" will look at a messy module and see options and
variations. The "code-sense" will help that programmer choose the best
variation and guide him or her to plot a sequence of behavior preserving
transformations to get from here to there.

In short, a programmer who writes clean code is an artist who can take a
blank screen through a series of transformations until it is an elegantly
coded system.

What Is Clean Code?
There are probably as many definitions as there are programmers. So I
asked some very well-known and deeply experienced programmers what
they thought.

Bjarne Stroustrup, inventor of C++ and author of The C++
Programming Language

         I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be
         straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies
         minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to
         an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not
         to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled
         optimizations. Clean code does one thing well.
Bjarne uses the word "elegant." That's quite a word! The dictionary in my
MacBook� provides the following definitions: pleasingly graceful and
stylish in appearance or manner; pleasingly ingenious and simple. Notice
the emphasis on the word "pleasing." Apparently Bjarne thinks that clean
code is pleasing to read. Reading it should make you smile the way a wellcrafted music box or well-designed car would.
Bjarne also mentions efficiency--twice. Perhaps this should not surprise us
coming from the inventor of C++; but I think there's more to it than the
sheer desire for speed. Wasted cycles are inelegant, they are not pleasing.
And now note the word that Bjarne uses to describe the consequence of that
inelegance. He uses the word "tempt." There is a deep truth here. Bad code
tempts the mess to grow! When others change bad code, they tend to make
it worse.

Pragmatic Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt said this a different way. They
used the metaphor of broken windows.3 A building with broken windows
looks like nobody cares about it. So other people stop caring. They allow
more windows to become broken. Eventually they actively break them.
They despoil the facade with graffiti and allow garbage to collect. One
broken window starts the process toward decay.

3. http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/booksellers/2004-12.html

Bjarne also mentions that error handling should be complete. This goes to
the discipline of paying attention to details. Abbreviated error handling is
just one way that programmers gloss over details. Memory leaks are
another, race conditions still another. Inconsistent naming yet another. The
upshot is that clean code exhibits close attention to detail.

Bjarne closes with the assertion that clean code does one thing well. It is no
accident that there are so many principles of software design that can be
boiled down to this simple admonition. Writer after writer has tried to
communicate this thought. Bad code tries to do too much, it has muddled
intent and ambiguity of purpose. Clean code is focused. Each function, each
class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely
undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details.

Grady Booch, author of Object Oriented Analysis and Design with
Applications
         Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written
         prose. Clean code never obscures the designer's intent but rather is
         full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.

Grady makes some of the same points as Bjarne, but he takes a readability
perspective. I especially like his view that clean code should read like wellwritten prose. Think back on a really good book that you've read.
Remember how the words disappeared to be replaced by images! It was like
watching a movie, wasn't it? Better! You saw the characters, you heard the
sounds, you experienced the pathos and the humor.

Reading clean code will never be quite like reading Lord of the Rings. Still,
the literary metaphor is not a bad one. Like a good novel, clean code should
clearly expose the tensions in the problem to be solved. It should build
those tensions to a climax and then give the reader that "Aha! Of course!"
as the issues and tensions are resolved in the revelation of an obvious
solution.

I find Grady's use of the phrase "crisp abstraction" to be a fascinating
oxymoron! After all the word "crisp" is nearly a synonym for "concrete."
My MacBook's dictionary holds the following definition of "crisp": briskly
decisive and matter-of-fact, without hesitation or unnecessary detail.
Despite this seeming juxtaposition of meaning, the words carry a powerful
message. Our code should be matter-of-fact as opposed to speculative. It
should contain only what is necessary. Our readers should perceive us to
have been decisive.
"Big" Dave Thomas, founder of OTI, godfather of the Eclipse strategy

         Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its
         original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful
         names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one
         thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and
         provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since
         depending on the language, not all necessary information can be
         expressed clearly in code alone.
Big Dave shares Grady's desire for readability, but with an important twist.
Dave asserts that clean code makes it easy for other people to enhance it.
This may seem obvious, but it cannot be overemphasized. There is, after all,
a difference between code that is easy to read and code that is easy to
change.
Dave ties cleanliness to tests! Ten years ago this would have raised a lot of
eyebrows. But the discipline of Test Driven Development has made a
profound impact upon our industry and has become one of our most
fundamental disciplines. Dave is right. Code, without tests, is not clean. No
matter how elegant it is, no matter how readable and accessible, if it hath
not tests, it be unclean.
Dave uses the word minimal twice. Apparently he values code that is small,
rather than code that is large. Indeed, this has been a common refrain
throughout software literature since its inception. Smaller is better.
Dave also says that code should be literate. This is a soft reference to
Knuth's literate programming.4 The upshot is that the code should be
composed in such a form as to make it readable by humans.

Michael Feathers, author of Working Effectively with Legacy Code

         I could list all of the qualities that I notice in clean code, but there is
         one overarching quality that leads to all of them. Clean code always
         looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing
         obvious that you can do to make it better. All of those things were
         thought about by the code's author, and if you try to imagine
         improvements, you're led back to where you are, sitting in
         appreciation of the code someone left for you--code left by someone
         who cares deeply about the craft.
One word: care. That's really the topic of this book. Perhaps an appropriate
subtitle would be How to Care for Code.
Michael hit it on the head. Clean code is code that has been taken care of.
Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and orderly. They have paid
appropriate attention to details. They have cared.
Ron Jeffries, author of Extreme Programming Installed and Extreme
Programming Adventures in C#
Ron began his career programming in Fortran at the Strategic Air
Command and has written code in almost every language and on almost
every machine. It pays to consider his words carefully.

         In recent years I begin, and nearly end, with Beck's rules of simple
         code. In priority order, simple code:
   � Runs all the tests;
   � Contains no duplication;
   � Expresses all the design ideas that are in the system;
   � Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions,
      and the like.
Of these, I focus mostly on duplication. When the same thing is done
over and over, it's a sign that there is an idea in our mind that is not
well represented in the code. I try to figure out what it is. Then I try
to express that idea more clearly.

Expressiveness to me includes meaningful names, and I am likely to
change the names of things several times before I settle in. With
modern coding tools such as Eclipse, renaming is quite inexpensive,
so it doesn't trouble me to change. Expressiveness goes beyond
names, however. I also look at whether an object or method is doing
more than one thing. If it's an object, it probably needs to be broken
into two or more objects. If it's a method, I will always use the
Extract Method refactoring on it, resulting in one method that says
more clearly what it does, and some submethods saying how it is
done.

Duplication and expressiveness take me a very long way into what I
consider clean code, and improving dirty code with just these two
things in mind can make a huge difference. There is, however, one
other thing that I'm aware of doing, which is a bit harder to explain.

After years of doing this work, it seems to me that all programs are
made up of very similar elements. One example is "find things in a
collection." Whether we have a database of employee records, or a
hash map of keys and values, or an array of items of some kind, we
often find ourselves wanting a particular item from that collection.
When I find that happening, I will often wrap the particular
implementation in a more abstract method or class. That gives me a
couple of interesting advantages.

I can implement the functionality now with something simple, say a
hash map, but since now all the references to that search are
covered by my little abstraction, I can change the implementation
any time I want. I can go forward quickly while preserving my
ability to change later.

In addition, the collection abstraction often calls my attention to
what's "really" going on, and keeps me from running down the path
of implementing arbitrary collection behavior when all I really need
is a few fairly simple ways of finding what I want.
         Reduced duplication, high expressiveness, and early building of
         simple abstractions. That's what makes clean code for me.
Here, in a few short paragraphs, Ron has summarized the contents of this
book. No duplication, one thing, expressiveness, tiny abstractions.
Everything is there.
Ward Cunningham, inventor of Wiki, inventor of Fit, coinventor of
eXtreme Programming. Motive force behind Design Patterns.
Smalltalk and OO thought leader. The godfather of all those who care
about code.

         You know you are working on clean code when each routine you
         read turns out to be pretty much what you expected. You can call it
         beautiful code when the code also makes it look like the language
         was made for the problem.
Statements like this are characteristic of Ward. You read it, nod your head,
and then go on to the next topic. It sounds so reasonable, so obvious, that it
barely registers as something profound. You might think it was pretty much
what you expected. But let's take a closer look.
"... pretty much what you expected." When was the last time you saw a
module that was pretty much what you expected? Isn't it more likely that
the modules you look at will be puzzling, complicated, tangled? Isn't
misdirection the rule? Aren't you used to flailing about trying to grab and
hold the threads of reasoning that spew forth from the whole system and
weave their way through the module you are reading? When was the last
time you read through some code and nodded your head the way you might
have nodded your head at Ward's statement?

Ward expects that when you read clean code you won't be surprised at all.
Indeed, you won't even expend much effort. You will read it, and it will be
pretty much what you expected. It will be obvious, simple, and compelling.
Each module will set the stage for the next. Each tells you how the next will
be written. Programs that are that clean are so profoundly well written that
you don't even notice it. The designer makes it look ridiculously simple like
all exceptional designs.

And what about Ward's notion of beauty? We've all railed against the fact
that our languages weren't designed for our problems. But Ward's statement
puts the onus back on us. He says that beautiful code makes the language
look like it was made for the problem! So it's our responsibility to make the
language look simple! Language bigots everywhere, beware! It is not the
language that makes programs appear simple. It is the programmer that
make the language appear simple!
Schools of Thought

What about me (Uncle Bob)? What do I think clean code is? This book will
tell you, in hideous detail, what I and my compatriots think about clean
code. We will tell you what we think makes a clean variable name, a clean
function, a clean class, etc. We will present these opinions as absolutes, and
we will not apologize for our stridence. To us, at this point in our careers,
they are absolutes. They are our school of thought about clean code.

Martial artists do not all agree about the best martial art, or the best
technique within a martial art. Often master martial artists will form their
own schools of thought and gather students to learn from them. So we see
Gracie Jiu Jistu, founded and taught by the Gracie family in Brazil. We see
Hakkoryu Jiu Jistu, founded and taught by Okuyama Ryuho in Tokyo. We
see Jeet Kune Do, founded and taught by Bruce Lee in the United States.
Students of these approaches immerse themselves in the teachings of the
founder. They dedicate themselves to learn what that particular master
teaches, often to the exclusion of any other master's teaching. Later, as the
students grow in their art, they may become the student of a different master
so they can broaden their knowledge and practice. Some eventually go on to
refine their skills, discovering new techniques and founding their own
schools.

None of these different schools is absolutely right. Yet within a particular
school we act as though the teachings and techniques are right. After all,
there is a right way to practice Hakkoryu Jiu Jitsu, or Jeet Kune Do. But this
rightness within a school does not invalidate the teachings of a different
school.

Consider this book a description of the Object Mentor School of Clean
Code. The techniques and teachings within are the way that we practice our
art. We are willing to claim that if you follow these teachings, you will
enjoy the benefits that we have enjoyed, and you will learn to write code
that is clean and professional. But don't make the mistake of thinking that
we are somehow "right" in any absolute sense. There are other schools and
other masters that have just as much claim to professionalism as we. It
would behoove you to learn from them as well.

Indeed, many of the recommendations in this book are controversial. You
will probably not agree with all of them. You might violently disagree with
some of them. That's fine. We can't claim final authority. On the other
hand, the recommendations in this book are things that we have thought
long and hard about. We have learned them through decades of experience
and repeated trial and error. So whether you agree or disagree, it would be a
shame if you did not see, and respect, our point of view.
We Are Authors

The @author field of a Javadoc tells us who we are. We are authors. And
one thing about authors is that they have readers. Indeed, authors are
responsible for communicating well with their readers. The next time you
write a line of code, remember you are an author, writing for readers who
will judge your effort.

You might ask: How much is code really read? Doesn't most of the effort
go into writing it?

Have you ever played back an edit session? In the 80s and 90s we had
editors like Emacs that kept track of every keystroke. You could work for
an hour and then play back your whole edit session like a high-speed
movie. When I did this, the results were fascinating.

The vast majority of the playback was scrolling and navigating to other
modules!

         Bob enters the module.
         He scrolls down to the function needing change.
         He pauses, considering his options.
         Oh, he's scrolling up to the top of the module to check the
         initialization of a variable.
         Now he scrolls back down and begins to type.
         Ooops, he's erasing what he typed!
         He types it again.
         He erases it again!
         He types half of something else but then erases that!
         He scrolls down to another function that calls the function he's
         changing to see how it is called.
         He scrolls back up and types the same code he just erased.
         He pauses.
         He erases that code again!
         He pops up another window and looks at a subclass. Is that function
         overridden?

         ...
You get the drift. Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading vs. writing is well
over 10:1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write
new code.

Because this ratio is so high, we want the reading of code to be easy, even if
it makes the writing harder. Of course there's no way to write code without
reading it, so making it easy to read actually makes it easier to write.

There is no escape from this logic. You cannot write code if you cannot read
the surrounding code. The code you are trying to write today will be hard or
easy to write depending on how hard or easy the surrounding code is to
read. So if you want to go fast, if you want to get done quickly, if you want
your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read.
The Boy Scout Rule

It's not enough to write the code well. The code has to be kept clean over
time. We've all seen code rot and degrade as time passes. So we must take
an active role in preventing this degradation.

The Boy Scouts of America have a simple rule that we can apply to our
profession.

Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.5

 5. This was adapted from Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell's farewell message to the
 Scouts: "Try and leave this world a little better than you found it..."

If we all checked-in our code a little cleaner than when we checked it out,
the code simply could not rot. The cleanup doesn't have to be something
big. Change one variable name for the better, break up one function that's a
little too large, eliminate one small bit of duplication, clean up one
composite if statement.

Can you imagine working on a project where the code simply got better as
time passed? Do you believe that any other option is professional? Indeed,
isn't continuous improvement an intrinsic part of professionalism?
Prequel and Principles

In many ways this book is a "prequel" to a book I wrote in 2002 entitled
Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices (PPP).
The PPP book concerns itself with the principles of object-oriented design,
and many of the practices used by professional developers. If you have not
read PPP, then you may find that it continues the story told by this book. If
you have already read it, then you'll find many of the sentiments of that
book echoed in this one at the level of code.

In this book you will find sporadic references to various principles of
design. These include the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), the Open
Closed Principle (OCP), and the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
among others. These principles are described in depth in PPP.
Conclusion

Books on art don't promise to make you an artist. All they can do is give
you some of the tools, techniques, and thought processes that other artists
have used. So too this book cannot promise to make you a good
programmer. It cannot promise to give you "code-sense." All it can do is
show you the thought processes of good programmers and the tricks,
techniques, and tools that they use.

Just like a book on art, this book will be full of details. There will be lots of
code. You'll see good code and you'll see bad code. You'll see bad code
transformed into good code. You'll see lists of heuristics, disciplines, and
techniques. You'll see example after example. After that, it's up to you.

Remember the old joke about the concert violinist who got lost on his way
to a performance? He stopped an old man on the corner and asked him how
to get to Carnegie Hall. The old man looked at the violinist and the violin
tucked under his arm, and said: "Practice, son. Practice!"

Meaningful Names

                              by Tim Ottinger
Introduction

Names are everywhere in software. We name our variables, our functions,
our arguments, classes, and packages. We name our source files and the
directories that contain them. We name our jar files and war files and ear
files. We name and name and name. Because we do so much of it, we'd
better do it well. What follows are some simple rules for creating good
names.
Use Intention-Revealing Names

It is easy to say that names should reveal intent. What we want to impress
upon you is that we are serious about this. Choosing good names takes time
but saves more than it takes. So take care with your names and change them
when you find better ones. Everyone who reads your code (including you)
will be happier if you do.

The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big
questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used.
If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.

          int d; // elapsed time in days

The name d reveals nothing. It does not evoke a sense of elapsed time, nor
of days. We should choose a name that specifies what is being measured
and the unit of that measurement:

          int elapsedTimeInDays;
          int daysSinceCreation;
          int daysSinceModification;
          int fileAgeInDays;

Choosing names that reveal intent can make it much easier to understand
and change code. What is the purpose of this code?

              List<int[]> list1 = new ArrayList<int[]>();
              for (int[] x : theList)
                  if (x[0] == 4)
                     list1.add(x);
              return list1;

          }

Why is it hard to tell what this code is doing? There are no complex
expressions. Spacing and indentation are reasonable. There are only three
variables and two constants mentioned. There aren't even any fancy classes
or polymorphic methods, just a list of arrays (or so it seems).

The problem isn't the simplicity of the code but the implicity of the code (to
coin a phrase): the degree to which the context is not explicit in the code
itself. The code implicitly requires that we know the answers to questions
such as:

      1. What kinds of things are in theList?

      2. What is the significance of the zeroth subscript of an item in
         theList?

      3. What is the significance of the value 4?

      4. How would I use the list being returned?

The answers to these questions are not present in the code sample, but they
could have been. Say that we're working in a mine sweeper game. We find
that the board is a list of cells called theList. Let's rename that to
gameBoard.

Each cell on the board is represented by a simple array. We further find that
the zeroth subscript is the location of a status value and that a status value
of 4 means "flagged." Just by giving these concepts names we can improve
the code considerably:

Click here to view code image

          public List<int[]> getFlaggedCells() {
              List<int[]> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<int[]>();
              for (int[] cell : gameBoard)
                if (cell[STATUS_VALUE] == FLAGGED)
                   flaggedCells.add(cell);
                return flaggedCells;

          }

Notice that the simplicity of the code has not changed. It still has exactly
the same number of operators and constants, with exactly the same number
of nesting levels. But the code has become much more explicit.

We can go further and write a simple class for cells instead of using an
array of ints. It can include an intention-revealing function (call it
isFlagged) to hide the magic numbers. It results in a new version of the
function:

Click here to view code image

          public List<Cell> getFlaggedCells() {
              List<Cell> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<Cell>();
              for (Cell cell : gameBoard)
                  if (cell.isFlagged())
                     flaggedCells.add(cell);
              return flaggedCells;
          }

With these simple name changes, it's not difficult to understand what's
going on. This is the power of choosing good names.
Avoid Disinformation

Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of
code. We should avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our
intended meaning. For example, hp, aix, and sco would be poor
variable names because they are the names of Unix platforms or variants.
Even if you are coding a hypotenuse and hp looks like a good abbreviation,
it could be disinformative.

Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless it's
actually a List. The word list means something specific to programmers.
If the container holding the accounts is not actually a List, it may lead to
false conclusions.1 So accountGroup or bunchOfAccounts or just
plain accounts would be better.

 1. As we'll see later on, even if the container is a List, it's probably better not to encode the
 container type into the name.

Beware of using names which vary in small ways. How long does it take to
spot the subtle difference between a
XYZControllerForEfficientHandlingOfStrings in one
module and, somewhere a little more distant,
XYZControllerForEfficientStorageOfStrings? The words
have frightfully similar shapes.

Spelling similar concepts similarly is information. Using inconsistent
spellings is disinformation. With modern Java environments we enjoy
automatic code completion. We write a few characters of a name and press
some hotkey combination (if that) and are rewarded with a list of possible
completions for that name. It is very helpful if names for very similar things
sort together alphabetically and if the differences are very obvious, because
the developer is likely to pick an object by name without seeing your
copious comments or even the list of methods supplied by that class.

A truly awful example of disinformative names would be the use of lowercase L or uppercase O as variable names, especially in combination. The
problem, of course, is that they look almost entirely like the constants one
and zero, respectively.
          int a = l;
          if ( O == l )

              a = O1;
          else

              l = 01;

The reader may think this a contrivance, but we have examined code where
such things were abundant. In one case the author of the code suggested
using a different font so that the differences were more obvious, a solution
that would have to be passed down to all future developers as oral tradition
or in a written document. The problem is conquered with finality and
without creating new work products by a simple renaming.
Make Meaningful Distinctions

Programmers create problems for themselves when they write code solely
to satisfy a compiler or interpreter. For example, because you can't use the
same name to refer to two different things in the same scope, you might be
tempted to change one name in an arbitrary way. Sometimes this is done by
misspelling one, leading to the surprising situation where correcting
spelling errors leads to an inability to compile.2

 2. Consider, for example, the truly hideous practice of creating a variable named klass just
 because the name class was used for something else.

It is not sufficient to add number series or noise words, even though the
compiler is satisfied. If names must be different, then they should also mean
something different.

Number-series naming (a1, a2, .. aN) is the opposite of intentional
naming. Such names are not disinformative--they are noninformative; they
provide no clue to the author's intention. Consider:

Click here to view code image

          public static void copyChars(char a1[], char a2[]) {
              for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++) {
                  a2[i] = a1[i];
              }

          }

This function reads much better when source and destination are
used for the argument names.

Noise words are another meaningless distinction. Imagine that you have a
Product class. If you have another called ProductInfo or
ProductData, you have made the names different without making them
mean anything different. Info and Data are indistinct noise words like a,
an, and the.
Note that there is nothing wrong with using prefix conventions like a and
the so long as they make a meaningful distinction. For example you might
use a for all local variables and the for all function arguments.3 The
problem comes in when you decide to call a variable theZork because
you already have another variable named zork.

3. Uncle Bob used to do this in C++ but has given up the practice because modern IDEs make it
unnecessary.

Noise words are redundant. The word variable should never appear in a
variable name. The word table should never appear in a table name. How
is NameString better than Name? Would a Name ever be a floating point
number? If so, it breaks an earlier rule about disinformation. Imagine
finding one class named Customer and another named
CustomerObject. What should you understand as the distinction?
Which one will represent the best path to a customer's payment history?

There is an application we know of where this is illustrated. we've changed
the names to protect the guilty, but here's the exact form of the error:

          getActiveAccount();
          getActiveAccounts();
          getActiveAccountInfo();

How are the programmers in this project supposed to know which of these
functions to call?

In the absence of specific conventions, the variable moneyAmount is
indistinguishable from money, customerInfo is indistinguishable
from customer, accountData is indistinguishable from account,
and theMessage is indistinguishable from message. Distinguish names
in such a way that the reader knows what the differences offer.
Use Pronounceable Names

Humans are good at words. A significant part of our brains is dedicated to
the concept of words. And words are, by definition, pronounceable. It
would be a shame not to take advantage of that huge portion of our brains
that has evolved to deal with spoken language. So make your names
pronounceable.

If you can't pronounce it, you can't discuss it without sounding like an
idiot. "Well, over here on the bee cee arr three cee enn tee we have a pee ess
zee kyew int, see?" This matters because programming is a social activity.

A company I know has genymdhms (generation date, year, month, day,
hour, minute, and second) so they walked around saying "gen why emm dee
aich emm ess". I have an annoying habit of pronouncing everything as
written, so I started saying "gen-yah-muddahims." It later was being called
this by a host of designers and analysts, and we still sounded silly. But we
were in on the joke, so it was fun. Fun or not, we were tolerating poor
naming. New developers had to have the variables explained to them, and
then they spoke about it in silly made-up words instead of using proper
English terms. Compare

          class DtaRcrd102 {
              private Date genymdhms;
              private Date modymdhms;
              private final String pszqint = "102";
              /* ... */

          };

              private Date modificationTimestamp;;
              private final String recordId = "102";
              /* ... */

          };

Intelligent conversation is now possible: "Hey, Mikey, take a look at this
record! The generation timestamp is set to tomorrow's date! How can that
be?"
Use Searchable Names

Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that
they are not easy to locate across a body of text.

One might easily grep for MAX_CLASSES_PER_STUDENT, but the
number 7 could be more troublesome. Searches may turn up the digit as
part of file names, other constant definitions, and in various expressions
where the value is used with different intent. It is even worse when a
constant is a long number and someone might have transposed digits,
thereby creating a bug while simultaneously evading the programmer's
search.

Likewise, the name e is a poor choice for any variable for which a
programmer might need to search. It is the most common letter in the
English language and likely to show up in every passage of text in every
program. In this regard, longer names trump shorter names, and any
searchable name trumps a constant in code.

My personal preference is that single-letter names can ONLY be used as
local variables inside short methods. The length of a name should
correspond to the size of its scope [N5]. If a variable or constant might be
seen or used in multiple places in a body of code, it is imperative to give it a
search-friendly name. Once again compare

          for (int j=0; j<34; j++) {
              s += (t[j]*4)/5;

          }

to

Click here to view code image

          int realDaysPerIdealDay = 4;
          const int WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK = 5;
          int sum = 0;
          for (int j=0; j < NUMBER_OF_TASKS; j++) {

              int realTaskDays = taskEstimate[j] * realDaysPerIdealDay;
              int realTaskWeeks = (realdays / WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK);
              sum += realTaskWeeks;
          }
Note that sum, above, is not a particularly useful name but at least is
searchable. The intentionally named code makes for a longer function, but
consider how much easier it will be to find WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK than
to find all the places where 5 was used and filter the list down to just the
instances with the intended meaning.
Avoid Encodings

We have enough encodings to deal with without adding more to our burden.
Encoding type or scope information into names simply adds an extra burden
of deciphering. It hardly seems reasonable to require each new employee to
learn yet another encoding "language" in addition to learning the (usually
considerable) body of code that they'll be working in. It is an unnecessary
mental burden when trying to solve a problem. Encoded names are seldom
pronounceable and are easy to mis-type.

Hungarian Notation

In days of old, when we worked in name-length-challenged languages, we
violated this rule out of necessity, and with regret. Fortran forced encodings
by making the first letter a code for the type. Early versions of BASIC
allowed only a letter plus one digit. Hungarian Notation (HN) took this to a
whole new level.

HN was considered to be pretty important back in the Windows C API,
when everything was an integer handle or a long pointer or a void pointer,
or one of several implementations of "string" (with different uses and
attributes). The compiler did not check types in those days, so the
programmers needed a crutch to help them remember the types.

In modern languages we have much richer type systems, and the compilers
remember and enforce the types. What's more, there is a trend toward
smaller classes and shorter functions so that people can usually see the
point of declaration of each variable they're using.

Java programmers don't need type encoding. Objects are strongly typed,
and editing environments have advanced such that they detect a type error
long before you can run a compile! So nowadays HN and other forms of
type encoding are simply impediments. They make it harder to change the
name or type of a variable, function, or class. They make it harder to read
the code. And they create the possibility that the encoding system will
mislead the reader.

          PhoneNumber phoneString;
          // name not changed when type changed!

Member Prefixes

You also don't need to prefix member variables with m_ anymore. Your
classes and functions should be small enough that you don't need them.
And you should be using an editing environment that highlights or colorizes
members to make them distinct.

Click here to view code image

          public class Part {
              private String m_dsc; // The textual description
              void setName(String name) {
                  m_dsc = name;
              }

          }
          _________________________________________________
          public class Part {

              String description;
              void setDescription(String description) {

                  this.description = description;
              }
          }

Besides, people quickly learn to ignore the prefix (or suffix) to see the
meaningful part of the name. The more we read the code, the less we see
the prefixes. Eventually the prefixes become unseen clutter and a marker of
older code.

Interfaces and Implementations

These are sometimes a special case for encodings. For example, say you are
building an ABSTRACT FACTORY for the creation of shapes. This factory will
be an interface and will be implemented by a concrete class. What should
you name them? IShapeFactory and ShapeFactory? I prefer to
leave interfaces unadorned. The preceding I, so common in today's legacy
wads, is a distraction at best and too much information at worst. I don't
want my users knowing that I'm handing them an interface. I just want
them to know that it's a ShapeFactory. So if I must encode either the
interface or the implementation, I choose the implementation. Calling it
ShapeFactoryImp, or even the hideous CShapeFactory, is
preferable to encoding the interface.
Avoid Mental Mapping

Readers shouldn't have to mentally translate your names into other names
they already know. This problem generally arises from a choice to use
neither problem domain terms nor solution domain terms.

This is a problem with single-letter variable names. Certainly a loop counter
may be named i or j or k (though never l!) if its scope is very small and
no other names can conflict with it. This is because those single-letter
names for loop counters are traditional. However, in most other contexts a
single-letter name is a poor choice; it's just a place holder that the reader
must mentally map to the actual concept. There can be no worse reason for
using the name c than because a and b were already taken.

In general programmers are pretty smart people. Smart people sometimes
like to show off their smarts by demonstrating their mental juggling
abilities. After all, if you can reliably remember that r is the lower-cased
version of the url with the host and scheme removed, then you must clearly
be very smart.

One difference between a smart programmer and a professional
programmer is that the professional understands that clarity is king.
Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can
understand.
Class Names

Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like
Customer, WikiPage, Account, and AddressParser. Avoid words
like Manager, Processor, Data, or Info in the name of a class. A
class name should not be a verb.
Method Names

Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like postPayment,
deletePage, or save. Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be
named for their value and prefixed with get, set, and is according to the
javabean standard.4

          string name = employee.getName();
          customer.setName("mike");
          if (paycheck.isPosted())...

When constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods with names
that describe the arguments. For example,

Click here to view code image

          Complex fulcrumPoint = Complex.FromRealNumber(23.0);

is generally better than

Click here to view code image

          Complex fulcrumPoint = new Complex(23.0);

Consider enforcing their use by making the corresponding constructors
private.
Don't Be Cute

If names are too clever, they will be memorable only to people who share
the author's sense of humor, and only as long as these people remember the
joke. Will they know what the function named HolyHandGrenade is
supposed to do? Sure, it's cute, but maybe in this case DeleteItems
might be a better name. Choose clarity over entertainment value.

Cuteness in code often appears in the form of colloquialisms or slang. For
example, don't use the name whack() to mean kill(). Don't tell little
culture-dependent jokes like eatMyShorts() to mean abort().
Say what you mean. Mean what you say.
Pick One Word per Concept

Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, it's
confusing to have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of
different classes. How do you remember which method name goes with
which class? Sadly, you often have to remember which company, group, or
individual wrote the library or class in order to remember which term was
used. Otherwise, you spend an awful lot of time browsing through headers
and previous code samples.

Modern editing environments like Eclipse and IntelliJ provide contextsensitive clues, such as the list of methods you can call on a given object.
But note that the list doesn't usually give you the comments you wrote
around your function names and parameter lists. You are lucky if it gives
the parameter names from function declarations. The function names have
to stand alone, and they have to be consistent in order for you to pick the
correct method without any additional exploration.

Likewise, it's confusing to have a controller and a manager and a
driver in the same code base. What is the essential difference between a
DeviceManager and a Protocol-Controller? Why are both not
controllers or both not managers? Are they both Drivers really? The
name leads you to expect two objects that have very different type as well
as having different classes.

A consistent lexicon is a great boon to the programmers who must use your
code.
Don't Pun

Avoid using the same word for two purposes. Using the same term for two
different ideas is essentially a pun.

If you follow the "one word per concept" rule, you could end up with many
classes that have, for example, an add method. As long as the parameter
lists and return values of the various add methods are semantically
equivalent, all is well.

However one might decide to use the word add for "consistency" when he
or she is not in fact adding in the same sense. Let's say we have many
classes where add will create a new value by adding or concatenating two
existing values. Now let's say we are writing a new class that has a method
that puts its single parameter into a collection. Should we call this method
add? It might seem consistent because we have so many other add
methods, but in this case, the semantics are different, so we should use a
name like insert or append instead. To call the new method add would
be a pun.

Our goal, as authors, is to make our code as easy as possible to understand.
We want our code to be a quick skim, not an intense study. We want to use
the popular paperback model whereby the author is responsible for making
himself clear and not the academic model where it is the scholar's job to dig
the meaning out of the paper.
Use Solution Domain Names

Remember that the people who read your code will be programmers. So go
ahead and use computer science (CS) terms, algorithm names, pattern
names, math terms, and so forth. It is not wise to draw every name from the
problem domain because we don't want our coworkers to have to run back
and forth to the customer asking what every name means when they already
know the concept by a different name.

The name AccountVisitor means a great deal to a programmer who is
familiar with the VISITOR pattern. What programmer would not know what
a JobQueue was? There are lots of very technical things that programmers
have to do. Choosing technical names for those things is usually the most
appropriate course.
Use Problem Domain Names

When there is no "programmer-eese" for what you're doing, use the name
from the problem domain. At least the programmer who maintains your
code can ask a domain expert what it means.

Separating solution and problem domain concepts is part of the job of a
good programmer and designer. The code that has more to do with problem
domain concepts should have names drawn from the problem domain.
Add Meaningful Context

There are a few names which are meaningful in and of themselves--most
are not. Instead, you need to place names in context for your reader by
enclosing them in well-named classes, functions, or namespaces. When all
else fails, then prefixing the name may be necessary as a last resort.

Imagine that you have variables named firstName, lastName,
street, houseNumber, city, state, and zipcode. Taken together
it's pretty clear that they form an address. But what if you just saw the
state variable being used alone in a method? Would you automatically
infer that it was part of an address?

You can add context by using prefixes: addrFirstName,
addrLastName, addrState, and so on. At least readers will
understand that these variables are part of a larger structure. Of course, a
better solution is to create a class named Address. Then, even the
compiler knows that the variables belong to a bigger concept.

Consider the method in Listing 2-1. Do the variables need a more
meaningful context? The function name provides only part of the context;
the algorithm provides the rest. Once you read through the function, you see
that the three variables, number, verb, and pluralModifier, are part
of the "guess statistics" message. Unfortunately, the context must be
inferred. When you first look at the method, the meanings of the variables
are opaque.

Listing 2-1 Variables with unclear context.

          private void printGuessStatistics(char candidate, int count)
     { String number;

                  String verb;
                  String pluralModifier;
                  if (count == 0) {

                     number = "no";
                     verb = "are";
                     pluralModifier = "s";
                  } else if (count == 1) {
                     number = "1";
                     verb = "is";
                     pluralModifier = "";
                  } else {

                     number = Integer.toString(count);
                     verb = "are";
                     pluralModifier = "s";
                  }
                  String guessMessage = String.format(
                     "There %s %s %s%s", verb, number, candidate,
     pluralModifier
                  );
                  print(guessMessage);
              }

The function is a bit too long and the variables are used throughout. To split
the function into smaller pieces we need to create a
GuessStatisticsMessage class and make the three variables fields
of this class. This provides a clear context for the three variables. They are
definitively part of the GuessStatisticsMessage. The improvement
of context also allows the algorithm to be made much cleaner by breaking it
into many smaller functions. (See Listing 2-2.)

Listing 2-2 Variables have a context.

   }

   private void thereIsOneLetter() {
       number = "1";
       verb = "is";
       pluralModifier = "";

   }

   private void thereAreNoLetters() {
       number = "no";
       verb = "are";
       pluralModifier = "s";

   }
}
Don't Add Gratuitous Context

In an imaginary application called "Gas Station Deluxe," it is a bad idea to
prefix every class with GSD. Frankly, you are working against your tools.
You type G and press the completion key and are rewarded with a mile-long
list of every class in the system. Is that wise? Why make it hard for the IDE
to help you?

Likewise, say you invented a MailingAddress class in GSD's
accounting module, and you named it GSDAccountAddress. Later, you
need a mailing address for your customer contact application. Do you use
GSDAccountAddress? Does it sound like the right name? Ten of 17
characters are redundant or irrelevant.

Shorter names are generally better than longer ones, so long as they are
clear. Add no more context to a name than is necessary.

The names accountAddress and customerAddress are fine names
for instances of the class Address but could be poor names for classes.
Address is a fine name for a class. If I need to differentiate between MAC
addresses, port addresses, and Web addresses, I might consider
PostalAddress, MAC, and URI. The resulting names are more precise,
which is the point of all naming.
Final Words

The hardest thing about choosing good names is that it requires good
descriptive skills and a shared cultural background. This is a teaching issue
rather than a technical, business, or management issue. As a result many
people in this field don't learn to do it very well.

People are also afraid of renaming things for fear that some other
developers will object. We do not share that fear and find that we are
actually grateful when names change (for the better). Most of the time we
don't really memorize the names of classes and methods. We use the
modern tools to deal with details like that so we can focus on whether the
code reads like paragraphs and sentences, or at least like tables and data
structure (a sentence isn't always the best way to display data). You will
probably end up surprising someone when you rename, just like you might
with any other code improvement. Don't let it stop you in your tracks.

Follow some of these rules and see whether you don't improve the
readability of your code. If you are maintaining someone else's code, use
refactoring tools to help resolve these problems. It will pay off in the short
term and continue to pay in the long run.
Functions

In the early days of programming we composed our systems of routines and
subroutines. Then, in the era of Fortran and PL/1 we composed our systems
of programs, subprograms, and functions. Nowadays only the function
survives from those early days. Functions are the first line of organization
in any program. Writing them well is the topic of this chapter.
Consider the code in Listing 3-1. It's hard to find a long function in
FitNesse,1 but after a bit of searching I came across this one. Not only is it
long, but it's got duplicated code, lots of odd strings, and many strange and
inobvious data types and APIs. See how much sense you can make of it in
the next three minutes.

                           .append("\n");
            }
         }

PathParser.render(tearDownPath);
                buffer.append("\n")
                           .append("!include -teardown .")
                           .append(tearDownPathName)
                           .append("\n");
            }
            if (includeSuiteSetup) {
                WikiPage suiteTeardown =
                    PageCrawlerImpl.getInheritedPage(

                                  SuiteResponder.SUITE_TEARDOWN_NAME,
                                  wikiPage
                    );
                     if (suiteTeardown != null) {
                         WikiPagePath pagePath =
                             suiteTeardown.getPageCrawler().getFullPath

     (suiteTeardown);
                         String pagePathName = PathParser.render(pagePath);
                         buffer.append("!include -teardown .")
                                    .append(pagePathName)
                                    .append("\n");

                     }
                  }
              }
              pageData.setContent(buffer.toString());
              return pageData.getHtml();
         }

Do you understand the function after three minutes of study? Probably not.
There's too much going on in there at too many different levels of
abstraction. There are strange strings and odd function calls mixed in with
doubly nested if statements controlled by flags.

However, with just a few simple method extractions, some renaming, and a
little restructuring, I was able to capture the intent of the function in the
nine lines of Listing 3-2. See whether you can understand that in the next 3
minutes.

Listing 3-2 HtmlUtil.java (refactored)

          public static String renderPageWithSetupsAndTeardowns(
              PageData pageData, boolean isSuite

          ) throws Exception {
              boolean isTestPage = pageData.hasAttribute("Test");
              if (isTestPage) {
                  WikiPage testPage = pageData.getWikiPage();
                  StringBuffer newPageContent = new StringBuffer();
                  includeSetupPages(testPage, newPageContent, isSuite);
                  newPageContent.append(pageData.getContent());
                  includeTeardownPages(testPage, newPageContent, isSuite);
                  pageData.setContent(newPageContent.toString());
              }

              return pageData.getHtml();
          }

Unless you are a student of FitNesse, you probably don't understand all the
details. Still, you probably understand that this function performs the
inclusion of some setup and teardown pages into a test page and then
renders that page into HTML. If you are familiar with JUnit,2 you probably
realize that this function belongs to some kind of Web-based testing
framework. And, of course, that is correct. Divining that information from
Listing 3-2 is pretty easy, but it's pretty well obscured by Listing 3-1.

2. An open-source unit-testing tool for Java. www.junit.org

So what is it that makes a function like Listing 3-2 easy to read and
understand? How can we make a function communicate its intent? What
attributes can we give our functions that will allow a casual reader to intuit
the kind of program they live inside?
Small!

The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of
functions is that they should be smaller than that. This is not an assertion
that I can justify. I can't provide any references to research that shows that
very small functions are better. What I can tell you is that for nearly four
decades I have written functions of all different sizes. I've written several
nasty 3,000-line abominations. I've written scads of functions in the 100 to
300 line range. And I've written functions that were 20 to 30 lines long.
What this experience has taught me, through long trial and error, is that
functions should be very small.

In the eighties we used to say that a function should be no bigger than a
screen-full. Of course we said that at a time when VT100 screens were 24
lines by 80 columns, and our editors used 4 lines for administrative
purposes. Nowadays with a cranked-down font and a nice big monitor, you
can fit 150 characters on a line and a 100 lines or more on a screen. Lines
should not be 150 characters long. Functions should not be 100 lines long.
Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long.

How short should a function be? In 1999 I went to visit Kent Beck at his
home in Oregon. We sat down and did some programming together. At one
point he showed me a cute little Java/Swing program that he called Sparkle.
It produced a visual effect on the screen very similar to the magic wand of
the fairy godmother in the movie Cinderella. As you moved the mouse, the
sparkles would drip from the cursor with a satisfying scintillation, falling to
the bottom of the window through a simulated gravitational field. When
Kent showed me the code, I was struck by how small all the functions were.
I was used to functions in Swing programs that took up miles of vertical
space. Every function in this program was just two, or three, or four lines
long. Each was transparently obvious. Each told a story. And each led you
to the next in a compelling order. That's how short your functions should
be!3

3. I asked Kent whether he still had a copy, but he was unable to find one. I searched all my old
computers too, but to no avail. All that is left now is my memory of that program.

How short should your functions be? They should usually be shorter than
Listing 3-2! Indeed, Listing 3-2 should really be shortened to Listing 3-3.
Listing 3-3 HtmlUtil.java (re-refactored)

Click here to view code image

          public static String renderPageWithSetupsAndTeardowns(
              PageData pageData, boolean isSuite) throws Exception {
              if (isTestPage(pageData))
                  includeSetupAndTeardownPages(pageData, isSuite);
              return pageData.getHtml();

          }

Blocks and Indenting

This implies that the blocks within if statements, else statements,
while statements, and so on should be one line long. Probably that line
should be a function call. Not only does this keep the enclosing function
small, but it also adds documentary value because the function called within
the block can have a nicely descriptive name.

This also implies that functions should not be large enough to hold nested
structures. Therefore, the indent level of a function should not be greater
than one or two. This, of course, makes the functions easier to read and
understand.
Do One Thing

It should be very clear that Listing 3-1 is doing lots more than one thing.
It's creating buffers, fetching pages, searching for inherited pages, rendering
paths, appending arcane strings, and generating HTML, among other things.
Listing 3-1 is very busy doing lots of different things. On the other hand,
Listing 3-3 is doing one simple thing. It's including setups and teardowns
into test pages.

The following advice has appeared in one form or another for 30 years or
more.
         FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING. THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL. THEY
         SHOULD DO IT ONLY.

The problem with this statement is that it is hard to know what "one thing"
is. Does Listing 3-3 do one thing? It's easy to make the case that it's doing
three things:

      1. Determining whether the page is a test page.

      2. If so, including setups and teardowns.

      3. Rendering the page in HTML.

So which is it? Is the function doing one thing or three things? Notice that
the three steps of the function are one level of abstraction below the stated
name of the function. We can describe the function by describing it as a
brief TO4 paragraph:

4. The LOGO language used the keyword "TO" in the same way that Ruby and Python use "def." So
every function began with the word "TO." This had an interesting effect on the way functions were
designed.

         TO RenderPageWithSetupsAndTeardowns, we check to see whether
         the page is a test page and if so, we include the setups and
         teardowns. In either case we render the page in HTML.

If a function does only those steps that are one level below the stated name
of the function, then the function is doing one thing. After all, the reason we
write functions is to decompose a larger concept (in other words, the name
of the function) into a set of steps at the next level of abstraction.

It should be very clear that Listing 3-1 contains steps at many different
levels of abstraction. So it is clearly doing more than one thing. Even
Listing 3-2 has two levels of abstraction, as proved by our ability to shrink
it down. But it would be very hard to meaningfully shrink Listing 3-3. We
could extract the if statement into a function named
includeSetupsAndTeardownsIfTestPage, but that simply
restates the code without changing the level of abstraction.

So, another way to know that a function is doing more than "one thing" is if
you can extract another function from it with a name that is not merely a
restatement of its implementation [G34].

Sections within Functions
Look at Listing 4-7 on page 71. Notice that the generatePrimes
function is divided into sections such as declarations, initializations, and
sieve. This is an obvious symptom of doing more than one thing. Functions
that do one thing cannot be reasonably divided into sections.
One Level of Abstraction per Function

In order to make sure our functions are doing "one thing," we need to make
sure that the statements within our function are all at the same level of
abstraction. It is easy to see how Listing 3-1 violates this rule. There are
concepts in there that are at a very high level of abstraction, such as
getHtml(); others that are at an intermediate level of abstraction, such
as: String pagePathName =
PathParser.render(pagePath); and still others that are
remarkably low level, such as: .append("\n").

Mixing levels of abstraction within a function is always confusing. Readers
may not be able to tell whether a particular expression is an essential
concept or a detail. Worse, like broken windows, once details are mixed
with essential concepts, more and more details tend to accrete within the
function.

Reading Code from Top to Bottom: The Stepdown Rule

We want the code to read like a top-down narrative.5 We want every
function to be followed by those at the next level of abstraction so that we
can read the program, descending one level of abstraction at a time as we
read down the list of functions. I call this The Step-down Rule.

5. [KP78], p. 37.

To say this differently, we want to be able to read the program as though it
were a set of TO paragraphs, each of which is describing the current level of
abstraction and referencing subsequent TO paragraphs at the next level
down.

         To include the setups and teardowns, we include setups, then we
         include the test page content, and then we include the teardowns.

         To include the setups, we include the suite setup if this is a suite,
         then we include the regular setup.

         To include the suite setup, we search the parent hierarchy for the
         "SuiteSetUp" page and add an include statement with the path of
         that page.
         To search the parent...

It turns out to be very difficult for programmers to learn to follow this rule
and write functions that stay at a single level of abstraction. But learning
this trick is also very important. It is the key to keeping functions short and
making sure they do "one thing." Making the code read like a top-down set
of TO paragraphs is an effective technique for keeping the abstraction level
consistent.

Take a look at Listing 3-7 at the end of this chapter. It shows the whole
testableHtml function refactored according to the principles described
here. Notice how each function introduces the next, and each function
remains at a consistent level of abstraction.
Switch Statements

It's hard to make a small switch statement.6 Even a switch statement
with only two cases is larger than I'd like a single block or function to be.
It's also hard to make a switch statement that does one thing. By their
nature, switch statements always do N things. Unfortunately we can't
always avoid switch statements, but we can make sure that each switch
statement is buried in a low-level class and is never repeated. We do this, of
course, with polymorphism.

6. And, of course, I include if/else chains in this.

Consider Listing 3-4. It shows just one of the operations that might depend
on the type of employee.

Listing 3-4 Payroll.java

Click here to view code image

          public Money calculatePay(Employee e)
          throws InvalidEmployeeType {

                  switch (e.type) {
                     case COMMISSIONED:
                         return calculateCommissionedPay(e);
                     case HOURLY:
                         return calculateHourlyPay(e);
                     case SALARIED:
                         return calculateSalariedPay(e);
                     default:
                         throw new InvalidEmployeeType(e.type);

                  }
              }

There are several problems with this function. First, it's large, and when
new employee types are added, it will grow. Second, it very clearly does
more than one thing. Third, it violates the Single Responsibility Principle7
(SRP) because there is more than one reason for it to change. Fourth, it
violates the Open Closed Principle8 (OCP) because it must change
whenever new types are added. But possibly the worst problem with this
function is that there are an unlimited number of other functions that will
have the same structure. For example we could have

7. a. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle
         b. http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp.pdf

8. a. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle

         b. http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/ocp.pdf

          isPayday(Employee e, Date date),

or

Click here to view code image

          deliverPay(Employee e, Money pay),

or a host of others. All of which would have the same deleterious structure.

The solution to this problem (see Listing 3-5) is to bury the switch
statement in the basement of an ABSTRACT FACTORY,9 and never let anyone
see it. The factory will use the switch statement to create appropriate
instances of the derivatives of Employee, and the various functions, such
as calculatePay, isPayday, and deliverPay, will be dispatched
polymorphically through the Employee interface.

9. [GOF].

My general rule for switch statements is that they can be tolerated if they
appear only once, are used to create polymorphic objects, and are hidden
behind an inheritance relationship so that the rest of the system can't see
them [G23]. Of course every circumstance is unique, and there are times
when I violate one or more parts of that rule.

              public abstract Money calculatePay();

          }
          -----------------
          public interface EmployeeFactory {

              public Employee makeEmployee(EmployeeRecord r) throws
     InvalidEmployeeType;

          }
          -----------------
          public class EmployeeFactoryImpl implements EmployeeFactory {

              public Employee makeEmployee(EmployeeRecord r) throws
InvalidEmployeeType {
            switch (r.type) {
                case COMMISSIONED:
                    return new CommissionedEmployee(r) ;
                case HOURLY:
                    return new HourlyEmployee(r);
                case SALARIED:
                    return new SalariedEmploye(r);
                default:
                    throw new InvalidEmployeeType(r.type);
            }

         }
     }
Use Descriptive Names

In Listing 3-7 I changed the name of our example function from
testableHtml to SetupTeardownIncluder.render. This is a far
better name because it better describes what the function does. I also gave
each of the private methods an equally descriptive name such as
isTestable or includeSetupAndTeardownPages. It is hard to
overestimate the value of good names. Remember Ward's principle: "You
know you are working on clean code when each routine turns out to be
pretty much what you expected." Half the battle to achieving that principle
is choosing good names for small functions that do one thing. The smaller
and more focused a function is, the easier it is to choose a descriptive name.

Don't be afraid to make a name long. A long descriptive name is better than
a short enigmatic name. A long descriptive name is better than a long
descriptive comment. Use a naming convention that allows multiple words
to be easily read in the function names, and then make use of those multiple
words to give the function a name that says what it does.

Don't be afraid to spend time choosing a name. Indeed, you should try
several different names and read the code with each in place. Modern IDEs
like Eclipse or IntelliJ make it trivial to change names. Use one of those
IDEs and experiment with different names until you find one that is as
descriptive as you can make it.

Choosing descriptive names will clarify the design of the module in your
mind and help you to improve it. It is not at all uncommon that hunting for
a good name results in a favorable restructuring of the code.

Be consistent in your names. Use the same phrases, nouns, and verbs in the
function names you choose for your modules. Consider, for example, the
names includeSetup-AndTeardownPages,
includeSetupPages, includeSuiteSetupPage, and
includeSetupPage. The similar phraseology in those names allows the
sequence to tell a story. Indeed, if I showed you just the sequence above,
you'd ask yourself: "What happened to includeTeardownPages,
includeSuiteTeardownPage, and includeTeardownPage?"
How's that for being "... pretty much what you expected."
Function Arguments

The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero (niladic). Next comes
one (monadic), followed closely by two (dyadic). Three arguments (triadic)
should be avoided where possible. More than three (polyadic) requires very
special justification--and then shouldn't be used anyway.

Arguments are hard. They take a lot of conceptual power. That's why I got
rid of almost all of them from the example. Consider, for instance, the
StringBuffer in the example. We could have passed it around as an
argument rather than making it an instance variable, but then our readers
would have had to interpret it each time they saw it. When you are reading
the story told by the module, includeSetupPage() is easier to
understand than includeSetupPageInto(newPage-Content).
The argument is at a different level of abstraction than the function name
and forces you to know a detail (in other words, StringBuffer) that
isn't particularly important at that point.
Arguments are even harder from a testing point of view. Imagine the
difficulty of writing all the test cases to ensure that all the various
combinations of arguments work properly. If there are no arguments, this is
trivial. If there's one argument, it's not too hard. With two arguments the
problem gets a bit more challenging. With more than two arguments, testing
every combination of appropriate values can be daunting.

Output arguments are harder to understand than input arguments. When we
read a function, we are used to the idea of information going in to the
function through arguments and out through the return value. We don't
usually expect information to be going out through the arguments. So
output arguments often cause us to do a double-take.

One input argument is the next best thing to no arguments.
SetupTeardown-Includer.render(pageData) is pretty easy to
understand. Clearly we are going to render the data in the pageData
object.

Common Monadic Forms

There are two very common reasons to pass a single argument into a
function. You may be asking a question about that argument, as in
boolean fileExists("MyFile"). Or you may be operating on that
argument, transforming it into something else and returning it. For example,
InputStream fileOpen("MyFile") transforms a file name
String into an InputStream return value. These two uses are what
readers expect when they see a function. You should choose names that
make the distinction clear, and always use the two forms in a consistent
context. (See Command Query Separation below.)

A somewhat less common, but still very useful form for a single argument
function, is an event. In this form there is an input argument but no output
argument. The overall program is meant to interpret the function call as an
event and use the argument to alter the state of the system, for example,
void passwordAttemptFailedNtimes(int attempts). Use
this form with care. It should be very clear to the reader that this is an event.
Choose names and contexts carefully.

Try to avoid any monadic functions that don't follow these forms, for
example, void includeSetupPageInto(StringBuffer
pageText). Using an output argument instead of a return value for a
transformation is confusing. If a function is going to transform its input
argument, the transformation should appear as the return value. Indeed,
StringBuffer transform(StringBuffer in) is better than
void transform(StringBuffer out), even if the implementation
in the first case simply returns the input argument. At least it still follows
the form of a transformation.

Flag Arguments

Flag arguments are ugly. Passing a boolean into a function is a truly terrible
practice. It immediately complicates the signature of the method, loudly
proclaiming that this function does more than one thing. It does one thing if
the flag is true and another if the flag is false!

In Listing 3-7 we had no choice because the callers were already passing
that flag in, and I wanted to limit the scope of refactoring to the function
and below. Still, the method call render(true) is just plain confusing to
a poor reader. Mousing over the call and seeing render(boolean
isSuite) helps a little, but not that much. We should have split the
function into two: renderForSuite() and
renderForSingleTest().

Dyadic Functions

A function with two arguments is harder to understand than a monadic
function. For example, writeField(name) is easier to understand than
writeField(output-Stream, name).10 Though the meaning of
both is clear, the first glides past the eye, easily depositing its meaning. The
second requires a short pause until we learn to ignore the first parameter.
And that, of course, eventually results in problems because we should never
ignore any part of code. The parts we ignore are where the bugs will hide.

10. I just finished refactoring a module that used the dyadic form. I was able to make the
outputStream a field of the class and convert all the writeField calls to the monadic form.
The result was much cleaner.

There are times, of course, where two arguments are appropriate. For
example, Point p = new Point(0,0); is perfectly reasonable.
Cartesian points naturally take two arguments. Indeed, we'd be very
surprised to see new Point(0). However, the two arguments in this case
are ordered components of a single value! Whereas output-Stream and
name have neither a natural cohesion, nor a natural ordering.

Even obvious dyadic functions like assertEquals(expected,
actual) are problematic. How many times have you put the actual
where the expected should be? The two arguments have no natural
ordering. The expected, actual ordering is a convention that requires
practice to learn.

Dyads aren't evil, and you will certainly have to write them. However, you
should be aware that they come at a cost and should take advantage of what
mechanisms may be available to you to convert them into monads. For
example, you might make the writeField method a member of
outputStream so that you can say outputStream.
writeField(name). Or you might make the outputStream a
member variable of the current class so that you don't have to pass it. Or
you might extract a new class like FieldWriter that takes the
outputStream in its constructor and has a write method.

Triads

Functions that take three arguments are significantly harder to understand
than dyads. The issues of ordering, pausing, and ignoring are more than
doubled. I suggest you think very carefully before creating a triad.

For example, consider the common overload of assertEquals that takes
three arguments: assertEquals(message, expected,
actual). How many times have you read the message and thought it
was the expected? I have stumbled and paused over that particular triad
many times. In fact, every time I see it, I do a double-take and then learn to
ignore the message.

On the other hand, here is a triad that is not quite so insidious:
assertEquals(1.0, amount, .001). Although this still requires a
double-take, it's one that's worth taking. It's always good to be reminded
that equality of floating point values is a relative thing.

Argument Objects
When a function seems to need more than two or three arguments, it is
likely that some of those arguments ought to be wrapped into a class of their
own. Consider, for example, the difference between the two following
declarations:

Click here to view code image

          Circle makeCircle(double x, double y, double radius);
          Circle makeCircle(Point center, double radius);

Reducing the number of arguments by creating objects out of them may
seem like cheating, but it's not. When groups of variables are passed
together, the way x and y are in the example above, they are likely part of a
concept that deserves a name of its own.

Argument Lists

Sometimes we want to pass a variable number of arguments into a function.
Consider, for example, the String.format method:

Click here to view code image

          String.format("%s worked %.2f hours.", name, hours);

If the variable arguments are all treated identically, as they are in the
example above, then they are equivalent to a single argument of type List.
By that reasoning, String.format is actually dyadic. Indeed, the
declaration of String.format as shown below is clearly dyadic.

Click here to view code image

          public String format(String format, Object... args)

So all the same rules apply. Functions that take variable arguments can be
monads, dyads, or even triads. But it would be a mistake to give them more
arguments than that.

Click here to view code image

          void monad(Integer... args);
          void dyad(String name, Integer... args);
          void triad(String name, int count, Integer... args);

Verbs and Keywords
Choosing good names for a function can go a long way toward explaining
the intent of the function and the order and intent of the arguments. In the
case of a monad, the function and argument should form a very nice
verb/noun pair. For example, write(name) is very evocative. Whatever
this "name" thing is, it is being "written." An even better name might be
writeField(name), which tells us that the "name" thing is a "field."

This last is an example of the keyword form of a function name. Using this
form we encode the names of the arguments into the function name. For
example, assertEquals might be better written as
assertExpectedEqualsActual(expected, actual). This
strongly mitigates the problem of having to remember the ordering of the
arguments.
Have No Side Effects

Side effects are lies. Your function promises to do one thing, but it also does
other hidden things. Sometimes it will make unexpected changes to the
variables of its own class. Sometimes it will make them to the parameters
passed into the function or to system globals. In either case they are devious
and damaging mistruths that often result in strange temporal couplings and
order dependencies.

Consider, for example, the seemingly innocuous function in Listing 3-6.
This function uses a standard algorithm to match a userName to a
password. It returns true if they match and false if anything goes
wrong. But it also has a side effect. Can you spot it?

Listing 3-6 UserValidator.java

Click here to view code image

          public class UserValidator {
              private Cryptographer cryptographer;

              public boolean checkPassword(String userName, String
     password) {

                  User user = UserGateway.findByName(userName);
                  if (user != User.NULL) {

                     String codedPhrase = user.
                     getPhraseEncodedByPassword();
                     String phrase = cryptographer.decrypt(codedPhrase,
     password);
                     if ("Valid Password".equals(phrase)) {

                         Session.initialize();
                         return true;
                     }
                  }
                  return false;
              }
          }

The side effect is the call to Session.initialize(), of course. The
checkPassword function, by its name, says that it checks the password.
The name does not imply that it initializes the session. So a caller who
believes what the name of the function says runs the risk of erasing the
existing session data when he or she decides to check the validity of the
user.

This side effect creates a temporal coupling. That is, checkPassword
can only be called at certain times (in other words, when it is safe to
initialize the session). If it is called out of order, session data may be
inadvertently lost. Temporal couplings are confusing, especially when
hidden as a side effect. If you must have a temporal coupling, you should
make it clear in the name of the function. In this case we might rename the
function checkPasswordAndInitializeSession, though that
certainly violates "Do one thing."

Output Arguments

Arguments are most naturally interpreted as inputs to a function. If you
have been programming for more than a few years, I'm sure you've done a
double-take on an argument that was actually an output rather than an input.
For example:

          appendFooter(s);

Does this function append s as the footer to something? Or does it append
some footer to s? Is s an input or an output? It doesn't take long to look at
the function signature and see:

Click here to view code image

          public void appendFooter(StringBuffer report)

This clarifies the issue, but only at the expense of checking the declaration
of the function. Anything that forces you to check the function signature is
equivalent to a double-take. It's a cognitive break and should be avoided.

In the days before object oriented programming it was sometimes necessary
to have output arguments. However, much of the need for output arguments
disappears in OO languages because this is intended to act as an output
argument. In other words, it would be better for appendFooter to be
invoked as

          report.appendFooter();

In general output arguments should be avoided. If your function must
change the state of something, have it change the state of its owning object.
Command Query Separation

Functions should either do something or answer something, but not both.
Either your function should change the state of an object, or it should return
some information about that object. Doing both often leads to confusion.
Consider, for example, the following function:

Click here to view code image

          public boolean set(String attribute, String value);

This function sets the value of a named attribute and returns true if it is
successful and false if no such attribute exists. This leads to odd
statements like this:

Click here to view code image

          if (set("username", "unclebob"))...

Imagine this from the point of view of the reader. What does it mean? Is it
asking whether the "username" attribute was previously set to
"unclebob"? Or is it asking whether the "username" attribute was
successfully set to "unclebob"? It's hard to infer the meaning from the
call because it's not clear whether the word "set" is a verb or an adjective.

The author intended set to be a verb, but in the context of the if
statement it feels like an adjective. So the statement reads as "If the
username attribute was previously set to unclebob" and not "set the
username attribute to unclebob and if that worked then...." We could
try to resolve this by renaming the set function to
setAndCheckIfExists, but that doesn't much help the readability of
the if statement. The real solution is to separate the command from the
query so that the ambiguity cannot occur.

Click here to view code image

          if (attributeExists("username")) {
              setAttribute("username", "unclebob");
              ...

          }
Prefer Exceptions to Returning Error Codes

Returning error codes from command functions is a subtle violation of
command query separation. It promotes commands being used as
expressions in the predicates of if statements.

          if (deletePage(page) == E_OK)

This does not suffer from verb/adjective confusion but does lead to deeply
nested structures. When you return an error code, you create the problem
that the caller must deal with the error immediately.

Click here to view code image

          if (deletePage(page) == E_OK) {
              if (registry.deleteReference(page.name) == E_OK) {
                  if (configKeys.deleteKey(page.name.makeKey()) == E_OK){
                     logger.log("page deleted");
                  } else {
                     logger.log("configKey not deleted");
                  }
              } else {
                  logger.log("deleteReference from registry failed");
              }

          } else {
              logger.log("delete failed");
              return E_ERROR;

          }

On the other hand, if you use exceptions instead of returned error codes,
then the error processing code can be separated from the happy path code
and can be simplified:

Click here to view code image

          try {
              deletePage(page);
              registry.deleteReference(page.name);
              configKeys.deleteKey(page.name.makeKey());

          }
          catch (Exception e) {

              logger.log(e.getMessage());
          }

Extract Try/Catch Blocks
Try/catch blocks are ugly in their own right. They confuse the structure
of the code and mix error processing with normal processing. So it is better
to extract the bodies of the try and catch blocks out into functions of
their own.

Click here to view code image

          public void delete(Page page) {
              try {
                  deletePageAndAllReferences(page);
              }
              catch (Exception e) {
                  logError(e);
              }

          }

     private void deletePageAndAllReferences(Page    page)  throws
Exception {

         deletePage(page);
         registry.deleteReference(page.name);
         configKeys.deleteKey(page.name.makeKey());
     }

private void logError(Exception e) {
   logger.log(e.getMessage());

}

In the above, the delete function is all about error processing. It is easy
to understand and then ignore. The deletePageAndAllReferences
function is all about the processes of fully deleting a page. Error handling
can be ignored. This provides a nice separation that makes the code easier
to understand and modify.

Error Handling Is One Thing

Functions should do one thing. Error handling is one thing. Thus, a function
that handles errors should do nothing else. This implies (as in the example
above) that if the keyword try exists in a function, it should be the very
first word in the function and that there should be nothing after the
catch/finally blocks.

The Error.java Dependency Magnet

Returning error codes usually implies that there is some class or enum in
which all the error codes are defined.
Click here to view code image

          public enum Error {
                OK,
                INVALID,
                NO_SUCH,
                LOCKED,
                OUT_OF_RESOURCES,

                WAITING_FOR_EVENT;
          }

Classes like this are a dependency magnet; many other classes must import
and use them. Thus, when the Error enum changes, all those other classes
need to be recompiled and redeployed.11 This puts a negative pressure on
the Error class. Programmers don't want to add new errors because then
they have to rebuild and redeploy everything. So they reuse old error codes
instead of adding new ones.

11. Those who felt that they could get away without recompiling and redeploying have been found--
and dealt with.

When you use exceptions rather than error codes, then new exceptions are
derivatives of the exception class. They can be added without forcing any
recompilation or redeployment.12

12. This is an example of the Open Closed Principle (OCP) [PPP02].
Don't Repeat Yourself13

13. The DRY principle. [PRAG].

Look back at Listing 3-1 carefully and you will notice that there is an
algorithm that gets repeated four times, once for each of the SetUp,
SuiteSetUp, TearDown, and SuiteTearDown cases. It's not easy to
spot this duplication because the four instances are intermixed with other
code and aren't uniformly duplicated. Still, the duplication is a problem
because it bloats the code and will require four-fold modification should the
algorithm ever have to change. It is also a four-fold opportunity for an error
of omission.

This duplication was remedied by the include method in Listing 3-7.
Read through that code again and notice how the readability of the whole
module is enhanced by the reduction of that duplication.
Duplication may be the root of all evil in software. Many principles and
practices have been created for the purpose of controlling or eliminating it.
Consider, for example, that all of Codd's database normal forms serve to
eliminate duplication in data. Consider also how object-oriented
programming serves to concentrate code into base classes that would
otherwise be redundant. Structured programming, Aspect Oriented
Programming, Component Oriented Programming, are all, in part, strategies
for eliminating duplication. It would appear that since the invention of the
subroutine, innovations in software development have been an ongoing
attempt to eliminate duplication from our source code.
Structured Programming

Some programmers follow Edsger Dijkstra's rules of structured
programming.14 Dijkstra said that every function, and every block within a
function, should have one entry and one exit. Following these rules means
that there should only be one return statement in a function, no break
or continue statements in a loop, and never, ever, any goto statements.

14. [SP72].

While we are sympathetic to the goals and disciplines of structured
programming, those rules serve little benefit when functions are very small.
It is only in larger functions that such rules provide significant benefit.

So if you keep your functions small, then the occasional multiple return,
break, or continue statement does no harm and can sometimes even be
more expressive than the single-entry, single-exit rule. On the other hand,
goto only makes sense in large functions, so it should be avoided.
How Do You Write Functions Like This?

Writing software is like any other kind of writing. When you write a paper
or an article, you get your thoughts down first, then you massage it until it
reads well. The first draft might be clumsy and disorganized, so you
wordsmith it and restructure it and refine it until it reads the way you want
it to read.

When I write functions, they come out long and complicated. They have
lots of indenting and nested loops. They have long argument lists. The
names are arbitrary, and there is duplicated code. But I also have a suite of
unit tests that cover every one of those clumsy lines of code.

So then I massage and refine that code, splitting out functions, changing
names, eliminating duplication. I shrink the methods and reorder them.
Sometimes I break out whole classes, all the while keeping the tests
passing.

In the end, I wind up with functions that follow the rules I've laid down in
this chapter. I don't write them that way to start. I don't think anyone could.
Conclusion

Every system is built from a domain-specific language designed by the
programmers to describe that system. Functions are the verbs of that
language, and classes are the nouns. This is not some throwback to the
hideous old notion that the nouns and verbs in a requirements document are
the first guess of the classes and functions of a system. Rather, this is a
much older truth. The art of programming is, and has always been, the art of
language design.

Master programmers think of systems as stories to be told rather than
programs to be written. They use the facilities of their chosen programming
language to construct a much richer and more expressive language that can
be used to tell that story. Part of that domain-specific language is the
hierarchy of functions that describe all the actions that take place within
that system. In an artful act of recursion those actions are written to use the
very domain-specific language they define to tell their own small part of the
story.

This chapter has been about the mechanics of writing functions well. If you
follow the rules herein, your functions will be short, well named, and nicely
organized. But never forget that your real goal is to tell the story of the
system, and that the functions you write need to fit cleanly together into a
clear and precise language to help you with that telling.

Comments

 "Don't comment bad code--rewrite it."
            --Brian W. Kernighan and P. J.
                                      Plaugher1

1. [KP78], p. 144.

Nothing can be quite so helpful as a well-placed comment. Nothing can
clutter up a module more than frivolous dogmatic comments. Nothing can
be quite so damaging as an old crufty comment that propagates lies and
misinformation.
Comments are not like Schindler's List. They are not "pure good." Indeed,
comments are, at best, a necessary evil. If our programming languages were
expressive enough, or if we had the talent to subtly wield those languages to
express our intent, we would not need comments very much--perhaps not
at all.
The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express
ourself in code. Note that I used the word failure. I meant it. Comments are
always failures. We must have them because we cannot always figure out
how to express ourselves without them, but their use is not a cause for
celebration.

So when you find yourself in a position where you need to write a
comment, think it through and see whether there isn't some way to turn the
tables and express yourself in code. Every time you express yourself in
code, you should pat yourself on the back. Every time you write a
comment, you should grimace and feel the failure of your ability of
expression.

Why am I so down on comments? Because they lie. Not always, and not
intentionally, but too often. The older a comment is, and the farther away it
is from the code it describes, the more likely it is to be just plain wrong.
The reason is simple. Programmers can't realistically maintain them.

Code changes and evolves. Chunks of it move from here to there. Those
chunks bifurcate and reproduce and come together again to form chimeras.
Unfortunately the comments don't always follow them--can't always
follow them. And all too often the comments get separated from the code
they describe and become orphaned blurbs of ever-decreasing accuracy. For
example, look what has happened to this comment and the line it was
intended to describe:

Click here to view code image

          MockRequest request;
          private final String HTTP_DATE_REGEXP =

              "[SMTWF][a-z]{2}\\,\\s[0-9]{2}\\s[JFMASOND][a-z]{2}\\s"+
              "[0-9]{4}\\s[0-9]{2}\\:[0-9]{2}\\:[0-9]{2}\\sGMT";
          private Response response;
          private FitNesseContext context;
          private FileResponder responder;
          private Locale saveLocale;
          // Example: "Tue, 02 Apr 2003 22:18:49 GMT"

Other instance variables that were probably added later were interposed
between the HTTP_DATE_REGEXP constant and it's explanatory
comment.
It is possible to make the point that programmers should be disciplined
enough to keep the comments in a high state of repair, relevance, and
accuracy. I agree, they should. But I would rather that energy go toward
making the code so clear and expressive that it does not need the comments
in the first place.

Inaccurate comments are far worse than no comments at all. They delude
and mislead. They set expectations that will never be fulfilled. They lay
down old rules that need not, or should not, be followed any longer.

Truth can only be found in one place: the code. Only the code can truly tell
you what it does. It is the only source of truly accurate information.
Therefore, though comments are sometimes necessary, we will expend
significant energy to minimize them.
Comments Do Not Make Up for Bad Code

One of the more common motivations for writing comments is bad code.
We write a module and we know it is confusing and disorganized. We know
it's a mess. So we say to ourselves, "Ooh, I'd better comment that!" No!
You'd better clean it!

Clear and expressive code with few comments is far superior to cluttered
and complex code with lots of comments. Rather than spend your time
writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning
that mess.
Explain Yourself in Code

There are certainly times when code makes a poor vehicle for explanation.
Unfortunately, many programmers have taken this to mean that code is
seldom, if ever, a good means for explanation. This is patently false. Which
would you rather see? This:

Click here to view code image

          // Check to see if the employee is eligible for full benefits
          if ((employee.flags & HOURLY_FLAG) &&

                  (employee.age > 65))

Or this?

Click here to view code image

          if (employee.isEligibleForFullBenefits())

It takes only a few seconds of thought to explain most of your intent in
code. In many cases it's simply a matter of creating a function that says the
same thing as the comment you want to write.
Good Comments

Some comments are necessary or beneficial. We'll look at a few that I
consider worthy of the bits they consume. Keep in mind, however, that the
only truly good comment is the comment you found a way not to write.

Legal Comments

Sometimes our corporate coding standards force us to write certain
comments for legal reasons. For example, copyright and authorship
statements are necessary and reasonable things to put into a comment at the
start of each source file.

Here, for example, is the standard comment header that we put at the
beginning of every source file in FitNesse. I am happy to say that our IDE
hides this comment from acting as clutter by automatically collapsing it.

Click here to view code image

          // Copyright (C) 2003,2004,2005 by Object Mentor, Inc. All
     rights reserved.

          // Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License
     version 2 or later.

Comments like this should not be contracts or legal tomes. Where possible,
refer to a standard license or other external document rather than putting all
the terms and conditions into the comment.

Informative Comments

It is sometimes useful to provide basic information with a comment. For
example, consider this comment that explains the return value of an abstract
method:

Click here to view code image

          // Returns an instance of the Responder being tested.
          protected abstract Responder responderInstance();

A comment like this can sometimes be useful, but it is better to use the
name of the function to convey the information where possible. For
example, in this case the comment could be made redundant by renaming
the function: responderBeingTested.
Here's a case that's a bit better:

Click here to view code image

          // format matched kk:mm:ss EEE, MMM dd, yyyy
          Pattern timeMatcher = Pattern.compile(

              "\\d*:\\d*:\\d* \\w*, \\w* \\d*, \\d*");

In this case the comment lets us know that the regular expression is
intended to match a time and date that were formatted with the
SimpleDateFormat.format function using the specified format
string. Still, it might have been better, and clearer, if this code had been
moved to a special class that converted the formats of dates and times. Then
the comment would likely have been superfluous.

Explanation of Intent

Sometimes a comment goes beyond just useful information about the
implementation and provides the intent behind a decision. In the following
case we see an interesting decision documented by a comment. When
comparing two objects, the author decided that he wanted to sort objects of
his class higher than objects of any other.

Click here to view code image

          public int compareTo(Object o)
          {

              if(o instanceof WikiPagePath)
              {

                  WikiPagePath p = (WikiPagePath) o;
                  String compressedName = StringUtil.join(names, "");
                  String compressedArgumentName = StringUtil.join(p.names,
     "");
                  return compressedName.compareTo(compressedArgumentName);
              }
              return 1; // we are greater because we are the right type.
          }

Here's an even better example. You might not agree with the programmer's
solution to the problem, but at least you know what he was trying to do.

Click here to view code image

          public void testConcurrentAddWidgets() throws Exception {
              WidgetBuilder widgetBuilder =
                  new WidgetBuilder(new Class[]{BoldWidget.class});
                  String text = "'''bold text'''";
                  ParentWidget parent =
                     new BoldWidget(new MockWidgetRoot(), "'''bold
     text'''");

                  AtomicBoolean failFlag = new AtomicBoolean();
                  failFlag.set(false);

                  //This is our best attempt to get a race condition
                  //by creating large number of threads.
                  for (int i = 0; i < 25000; i++) {

                     WidgetBuilderThread widgetBuilderThread =
                         new WidgetBuilderThread(widgetBuilder, text, parent,

     failFlag);
                     Thread thread = new Thread(widgetBuilderThread);
                     thread.start();

                  }
                  assertEquals(false, failFlag.get());
              }

Clarification

Sometimes it is just helpful to translate the meaning of some obscure
argument or return value into something that's readable. In general it is
better to find a way to make that argument or return value clear in its own
right; but when its part of the standard library, or in code that you cannot
alter, then a helpful clarifying comment can be useful.

Click here to view code image

          public void testCompareTo() throws Exception
          {

              WikiPagePath a = PathParser.parse("PageA");
              WikiPagePath ab = PathParser.parse("PageA.PageB");
              WikiPagePath b = PathParser.parse("PageB");
              WikiPagePath aa = PathParser.parse("PageA.PageA");
              WikiPagePath bb = PathParser.parse("PageB.PageB");
              WikiPagePath ba = PathParser.parse("PageB.PageA");

              assertTrue(a.compareTo(a) == 0); // a == a
              assertTrue(a.compareTo(b) != 0); // a != b
              assertTrue(ab.compareTo(ab) == 0); // ab == ab
              assertTrue(a.compareTo(b) == -1); // a < b
              assertTrue(aa.compareTo(ab) == -1); // aa < ab
              assertTrue(ba.compareTo(bb) == -1); // ba < bb
              assertTrue(b.compareTo(a) == 1); // b > a
              assertTrue(ab.compareTo(aa) == 1); // ab > aa
              assertTrue(bb.compareTo(ba) == 1); // bb > ba
          }

There is a substantial risk, of course, that a clarifying comment is incorrect.
Go through the previous example and see how difficult it is to verify that
they are correct. This explains both why the clarification is necessary and
why it's risky. So before writing comments like this, take care that there is
no better way, and then take even more care that they are accurate.

Warning of Consequences
Sometimes it is useful to warn other programmers about certain
consequences. For example, here is a comment that explains why a
particular test case is turned off:

Click here to view code image
          // Don't run unless you
          // have some time to kill.
          public void _testWithReallyBigFile()
          {
              writeLinesToFile(10000000);

              response.setBody(testFile);
              response.readyToSend(this);
              String responseString = output.toString();
              assertSubString("Content-Length: 1000000000",
     responseString);
              assertTrue(bytesSent > 1000000000);
          }

Nowadays, of course, we'd turn off the test case by using the @Ignore
attribute with an appropriate explanatory string. @Ignore("Takes too
long to run"). But back in the days before JUnit 4, putting an
underscore in front of the method name was a common convention. The
comment, while flippant, makes the point pretty well.
Here's another, more poignant example:

Click here to view code image
          public static SimpleDateFormat makeStandardHttpDateFormat()
          {

              //SimpleDateFormat is not thread safe,
              //so we need to create each instance independently.
              SimpleDateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat("EEE, dd
     MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss z");
              df.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("GMT"));
              return df;
          }

You might complain that there are better ways to solve this problem. I
might agree with you. But the comment, as given here, is perfectly
reasonable. It will prevent some overly eager programmer from using a
static initializer in the name of efficiency.

TODO Comments

It is sometimes reasonable to leave "To do" notes in the form of //TODO
comments. In the following case, the TODO comment explains why the
function has a degenerate implementation and what that function's future
should be.

Click here to view code image

//TODO-MdM these are not needed                       model
// We expect this to go away when we do the checkout
protected VersionInfo makeVersion() throws Exception
{

   return null;
}

TODOs are jobs that the programmer thinks should be done, but for some
reason can't do at the moment. It might be a reminder to delete a deprecated
feature or a plea for someone else to look at a problem. It might be a request
for someone else to think of a better name or a reminder to make a change
that is dependent on a planned event. Whatever else a TODO might be, it is
not an excuse to leave bad code in the system.

Nowadays, most good IDEs provide special gestures and features to locate
all the TODO comments, so it's not likely that they will get lost. Still, you
don't want your code to be littered with TODOs. So scan through them
regularly and eliminate the ones you can.

Amplification
A comment may be used to amplify the importance of something that may
otherwise seem inconsequential.

Click here to view code image

          String listItemContent = match.group(3).trim();
          // the trim is real important. It removes the starting
          // spaces that could cause the item to be recognized
          // as another list.
          new ListItemWidget(this, listItemContent, this.level + 1);
          return buildList(text.substring(match.end()));

Javadocs in Public APIs

There is nothing quite so helpful and satisfying as a well-described public
API. The java-docs for the standard Java library are a case in point. It
would be difficult, at best, to write Java programs without them.

If you are writing a public API, then you should certainly write good
javadocs for it. But keep in mind the rest of the advice in this chapter.
Javadocs can be just as misleading, nonlocal, and dishonest as any other
kind of comment.
Bad Comments

Most comments fall into this category. Usually they are crutches or excuses
for poor code or justifications for insufficient decisions, amounting to little
more than the programmer talking to himself.

Mumbling

Plopping in a comment just because you feel you should or because the
process requires it, is a hack. If you decide to write a comment, then spend
the time necessary to make sure it is the best comment you can write.

Here, for example, is a case I found in FitNesse, where a comment might
indeed have been useful. But the author was in a hurry or just not paying
much attention. His mumbling left behind an enigma:

Click here to view code image

     public void loadProperties()                      + "/" +
     {                                                 are loaded

         try
         {

          String propertiesPath = propertiesLocation
PROPERTIES_FILE;

          FileInputStream propertiesStream = new
FileInputStream(propertiesPath);

          loadedProperties.load(propertiesStream);
         }
         catch(IOException e)
         {

            // No properties files means all defaults
         }
     }

What does that comment in the catch block mean? Clearly it meant
something to the author, but the meaning does not come through all that
well. Apparently, if we get an IOException, it means that there was no
properties file; and in that case all the defaults are loaded. But who loads all
the defaults? Were they loaded before the call to
loadProperties.load? Or did loadProperties.load catch the
exception, load the defaults, and then pass the exception on for us to
ignore? Or did loadProperties.load load all the defaults before
attempting to load the file? Was the author trying to comfort himself about
the fact that he was leaving the catch block empty? Or--and this is the
scary possibility--was the author trying to tell himself to come back here
later and write the code that would load the defaults?

Our only recourse is to examine the code in other parts of the system to find
out what's going on. Any comment that forces you to look in another
module for the meaning of that comment has failed to communicate to you
and is not worth the bits it consumes.

Redundant Comments

Listing 4-1 shows a simple function with a header comment that is
completely redundant. The comment probably takes longer to read than the
code itself.

Listing 4-1 waitForClose

Click here to view code image

          // Utility method that returns when this.closed is true.
     Throws an exception

          // if the timeout is reached.
          public synchronized void waitForClose(final long
     timeoutMillis)
          throws Exception
          {

                if(!closed)
                {

                     wait(timeoutMillis);
                     if(!closed)

                         throw new Exception("MockResponseSender could not be
     closed");

                }
          }

What purpose does this comment serve? It's certainly not more informative
than the code. It does not justify the code, or provide intent or rationale. It is
not easier to read than the code. Indeed, it is less precise than the code and
entices the reader to accept that lack of precision in lieu of true
understanding. It is rather like a gladhanding used-car salesman assuring
you that you don't need to look under the hood.

Now consider the legion of useless and redundant javadocs in Listing 4-2
taken from Tomcat. These comments serve only to clutter and obscure the
code. They serve no documentary purpose at all. To make matters worse, I
only showed you the first few. There are many more in this module.

Container
          * is associated.
                */
              protected DirContext resources = null;

Misleading Comments

Sometimes, with all the best intentions, a programmer makes a statement in
his comments that isn't precise enough to be accurate. Consider for another
moment the badly redundant but also subtly misleading comment we saw in
Listing 4-1.

Did you discover how the comment was misleading? The method does not
return when this.closed becomes true. It returns if this.closed
is true; otherwise, it waits for a blind time-out and then throws an
exception if this.closed is still not true.

This subtle bit of misinformation, couched in a comment that is harder to
read than the body of the code, could cause another programmer to blithely
call this function in the expectation that it will return as soon as
this.closed becomes true. That poor programmer would then find
himself in a debugging session trying to figure out why his code executed
so slowly.

Mandated Comments

It is just plain silly to have a rule that says that every function must have a
javadoc, or every variable must have a comment. Comments like this just
clutter up the code, propagate lies, and lend to general confusion and
disorganization.

For example, required javadocs for every function lead to abominations
such as Listing 4-3. This clutter adds nothing and serves only to obfuscate
the code and create the potential for lies and misdirection.

public void addCD(String title, String author,
                                  int tracks, int durationInMinutes) {

   CD cd = new CD();
   cd.title = title;
   cd.author = author;
   cd.tracks = tracks;
   cd.duration = duration;
   cdList.add(cd);
}

Journal Comments

Sometimes people add a comment to the start of a module every time they
edit it. These comments accumulate as a kind of journal, or log, of every
change that has ever been made. I have seen some modules with dozens of
pages of these run-on journal entries.

Long ago there was a good reason to create and maintain these log entries at
the start of every module. We didn't have source code control systems that
did it for us. Nowadays, however, these long journals are just more clutter
to obfuscate the module. They should be completely removed.

Noise Comments

Sometimes you see comments that are nothing but noise. They restate the
obvious and provide no new information.

Click here to view code image

          /**
            * Default constructor.
            */

          protected AnnualDateRule() {
          }

No, really? Or how about this:

Click here to view code image

          /** The day of the month. */
                  private int dayOfMonth;

And then there's this paragon of redundancy:

Click here to view code image

          /**
              * Returns the day of the month.
              *
              * @return the day of the month.
              */

            public int getDayOfMonth() {
                return dayOfMonth;

          }

These comments are so noisy that we learn to ignore them. As we read
through code, our eyes simply skip over them. Eventually the comments
begin to lie as the code around them changes.

The first comment in Listing 4-4 seems appropriate.2 It explains why the
catch block is being ignored. But the second comment is pure noise.
Apparently the programmer was just so frustrated with writing try/catch
blocks in this function that he needed to vent.
2. The current trend for IDEs to check spelling in comments will be a balm for those of us who read
a lot of code.

Listing 4-4 startSending

Click here to view code image

          private void startSending()
          {

              try
              {

                  doSending();
              }
              catch(SocketException e)
              {

                  // normal. someone stopped the request.
              }
              catch(Exception e)
              {

                  try
                  {

                     response.add(ErrorResponder.makeExceptionString(e));
                     response.closeAll();
                  }
                  catch(Exception e1)
                  {
                     //Give me a break!
                  }
              }
          }

Rather than venting in a worthless and noisy comment, the programmer
should have recognized that his frustration could be resolved by improving
the structure of his code. He should have redirected his energy to extracting
that last try/catch block into a separate function, as shown in Listing 45.

                  {
                  }
              }

Replace the temptation to create noise with the determination to clean your
code. You'll find it makes you a better and happier programmer.

Scary Noise

Javadocs can also be noisy. What purpose do the following Javadocs (from
a well-known open-source library) serve? Answer: nothing. They are just
redundant noisy comments written out of some misplaced desire to provide
documentation.

Click here to view code image

          /** The name. */
          private String name;

          /** The version. */
          private String version;

          /** The licenceName. */
          private String licenceName;

          /** The version. */
          private String info;

Read these comments again more carefully. Do you see the cut-paste error?
If authors aren't paying attention when comments are written (or pasted),
why should readers be expected to profit from them?
Don't Use a Comment When You Can Use a Function or a Variable

Consider the following stretch of code:

Click here to view code image

          // does the module from the global list <mod> depend on the
          // subsystem we are part of?
          if
     (smodule.getDependSubsystems().contains(subSysMod.getSubSystem()
     ))

This could be rephrased without the comment as

Click here to view code image

          ArrayList moduleDependees = smodule.getDependSubsystems();
          String ourSubSystem = subSysMod.getSubSystem();
          if (moduleDependees.contains(ourSubSystem))

The author of the original code may have written the comment first
(unlikely) and then written the code to fulfill the comment. However, the
author should then have refactored the code, as I did, so that the comment
could be removed.

Position Markers

Sometimes programmers like to mark a particular position in a source file.
For example, I recently found this in a program I was looking through:

Click here to view code image

          // Actions //////////////////////////////////

There are rare times when it makes sense to gather certain functions
together beneath a banner like this. But in general they are clutter that
should be eliminated--especially the noisy train of slashes at the end.

Think of it this way. A banner is startling and obvious if you don't see
banners very often. So use them very sparingly, and only when the benefit
is significant. If you overuse banners, they'll fall into the background noise
and be ignored.

Closing Brace Comments

Sometimes programmers will put special comments on closing braces, as in
Listing 4-6. Although this might make sense for long functions with deeply
nested structures, it serves only to clutter the kind of small and encapsulated
functions that we prefer. So if you find yourself wanting to mark your
closing braces, try to shorten your functions instead.

Listing 4-6 wc.java

Click here to view code image

          public class wc {
              public static void main(String[] args) {
                  BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new

     InputStreamReader(System.in));
                  String line;
                  int lineCount = 0;
                  int charCount = 0;
                  int wordCount = 0;
                  try {
                       while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {
                           lineCount++;
                           charCount += line.length();
                           String words[] = line.split("\\W");
                           wordCount += words.length;
                       } //while
                       System.out.println("wordCount = " + wordCount);
                       System.out.println("lineCount = " + lineCount);
                       System.out.println("charCount = " + charCount);
                  } // try
                  catch (IOException e) {
                     System.err.println("Error:" + e.getMessage());
                  } //catch

              } //main
          }

Attributions and Bylines

          /* Added by Rick */

Source code control systems are very good at remembering who added
what, when. There is no need to pollute the code with little bylines. You
might think that such comments would be useful in order to help others
know who to talk to about the code. But the reality is that they tend to stay
around for years and years, getting less and less accurate and relevant.

Again, the source code control system is a better place for this kind of
information.

Commented-Out Code
Few practices are as odious as commenting-out code. Don't do this!

Click here to view code image

                InputStreamResponse response = new InputStreamResponse();
                response.setBody(formatter.getResultStream(),
     formatter.getByteCount());
          // InputStream resultsStream = formatter.getResultStream();
          // StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(resultsStream);
          //
     response.setContent(reader.read(formatter.getByteCount()));

Others who see that commented-out code won't have the courage to delete
it. They'll think it is there for a reason and is too important to delete. So
commented-out code gathers like dregs at the bottom of a bad bottle of
wine.

Consider this from apache commons:

Click here to view code image

          this.bytePos = writeBytes(pngIdBytes, 0);
          //hdrPos = bytePos;
          writeHeader();
          writeResolution();
          //dataPos = bytePos;
          if (writeImageData()) {

                  writeEnd();
                  this.pngBytes = resizeByteArray(this.pngBytes,
     this.maxPos);
          }

          else {
                   this.pngBytes = null;

          }
          return this.pngBytes;

Why are those two lines of code commented? Are they important? Were
they left as reminders for some imminent change? Or are they just cruft that
someone commented-out years ago and has simply not bothered to clean
up.

There was a time, back in the sixties, when commenting-out code might
have been useful. But we've had good source code control systems for a
very long time now. Those systems will remember the code for us. We don't
have to comment it out any more. Just delete the code. We won't lose it.
Promise.
HTML Comments

HTML in source code comments is an abomination, as you can tell by
reading the code below. It makes the comments hard to read in the one
place where they should be easy to read--the editor/IDE. If comments are
going to be extracted by some tool (like Javadoc) to appear in a Web page,
then it should be the responsibility of that tool, and not the programmer, to
adorn the comments with appropriate HTML.

Nonlocal Information

If you must write a comment, then make sure it describes the code it
appears near. Don't offer systemwide information in the context of a local
comment. Consider, for example, the javadoc comment below. Aside from
the fact that it is horribly redundant, it also offers information about the
default port. And yet the function has absolutely no control over what that
default is. The comment is not describing the function, but some other, far
distant part of the system. Of course there is no guarantee that this comment
will be changed when the code containing the default is changed.

Click here to view code image
          /**
            * Port on which fitnesse would run. Defaults to 8082.
            *
            * @param fitnessePort
            */

          public void setFitnessePort(int fitnessePort)
          {

              this.fitnessePort = fitnessePort;
          }

Too Much Information

Don't put interesting historical discussions or irrelevant descriptions of
details into your comments. The comment below was extracted from a
module designed to test that a function could encode and decode base64.
Other than the RFC number, someone reading this code has no need for the
arcane information contained in the comment.

Click here to view code image

          /*
                  RFC 2045 - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
                  Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies
                  section 6.8. Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding
                  The encoding process represents 24-bit groups of input

     bits as output
                  strings of 4 encoded characters. Proceeding from left to

     right, a
                  24-bit input group is formed by concatenating 3 8-bit

     input groups.
                  These 24 bits are then treated as 4 concatenated 6-bit

     groups, each
                  of which is translated into a single digit in the base64

     alphabet.
                  When encoding a bit stream via the base64 encoding, the

     bit stream
                  must be presumed to be ordered with the most-significant-

     bit first.
                  That is, the first bit in the stream will be the high-

     order bit in
                  the first 8-bit byte, and the eighth bit will be the low-

     order bit in
                  the first 8-bit byte, and so on.

              */

Inobvious Connection
The connection between a comment and the code it describes should be
obvious. If you are going to the trouble to write a comment, then at least
you'd like the reader to be able to look at the comment and the code and
understand what the comment is talking about.

Consider, for example, this comment drawn from apache commons:

Click here to view code image

          /*
            * start with an array that is big enough to hold all the

     pixels
            * (plus filter bytes), and an extra 200 bytes for header

     info
            */

          this.pngBytes = new byte[((this.width + 1) * this.height * 3)
     + 200];

What is a filter byte? Does it relate to the +1? Or to the *3? Both? Is a pixel
a byte? Why 200? The purpose of a comment is to explain code that does
not explain itself. It is a pity when a comment needs its own explanation.

Function Headers

Short functions don't need much description. A well-chosen name for a
small function that does one thing is usually better than a comment header.

Javadocs in Nonpublic Code

As useful as javadocs are for public APIs, they are anathema to code that is
not intended for public consumption. Generating javadoc pages for the
classes and functions inside a system is not generally useful, and the extra
formality of the javadoc comments amounts to little more than cruft and
distraction.

Example

I wrote the module in Listing 4-7 for the first XP Immersion. It was
intended to be an example of bad coding and commenting style. Kent Beck
then refactored this code into a much more pleasant form in front of several
dozen enthusiastic students. Later I adapted the example for my book Agile
Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices and the first of
my Craftsman articles published in Software Development magazine.
What I find fascinating about this module is that there was a time when
many of us would have considered it "well documented." Now we see it as
a small mess. See how many different comment problems you can find.

It is easy to argue that the first comment is redundant because it reads very
much like the generatePrimes function itself. Still, I think the
comment serves to ease the reader into the algorithm, so I'm inclined to
leave it.

The second argument is almost certainly necessary. It explains the rationale
behind the use of the square root as the loop limit. I could find no simple
variable name, nor any different coding structure that made this point clear.
On the other hand, the use of the square root might be a conceit. Am I really
saving that much time by limiting the iteration to the square root? Could the
calculation of the square root take more time than I'm saving?

It's worth thinking about. Using the square root as the iteration limit
satisfies the old C and assembly language hacker in me, but I'm not
convinced it's worth the time and effort that everyone else will expend to
understand it.

Formatting

When people look under the hood, we want them to be impressed with the
neatness, consistency, and attention to detail that they perceive. We want
them to be struck by the orderliness. We want their eyebrows to rise as they
scroll through the modules. We want them to perceive that professionals
have been at work. If instead they see a scrambled mass of code that looks
like it was written by a bevy of drunken sailors, then they are likely to
conclude that the same inattention to detail pervades every other aspect of
the project.
You should take care that your code is nicely formatted. You should choose
a set of simple rules that govern the format of your code, and then you
should consistently apply those rules. If you are working on a team, then the
team should agree to a single set of formatting rules and all members should
comply. It helps to have an automated tool that can apply those formatting
rules for you.
The Purpose of Formatting

First of all, let's be clear. Code formatting is important. It is too important
to ignore and it is too important to treat religiously. Code formatting is
about communication, and communication is the professional developer's
first order of business.

Perhaps you thought that "getting it working" was the first order of business
for a professional developer. I hope by now, however, that this book has
disabused you of that idea. The functionality that you create today has a
good chance of changing in the next release, but the readability of your
code will have a profound effect on all the changes that will ever be made.
The coding style and readability set precedents that continue to affect
maintainability and extensibility long after the original code has been
changed beyond recognition. Your style and discipline survives, even
though your code does not.

So what are the formatting issues that help us to communicate best?
Vertical Formatting

Let's start with vertical size. How big should a source file be? In Java, file
size is closely related to class size. We'll talk about class size when we talk
about classes. For the moment let's just consider file size.

How big are most Java source files? It turns out that there is a huge range of
sizes and some remarkable differences in style. Figure 5-1 shows some of
those differences.

Seven different projects are depicted. Junit, FitNesse, testNG, Time and
Money, JDepend, Ant, and Tomcat. The lines through the boxes show the
minimum and maximum file lengths in each project. The box shows
approximately one-third (one standard deviation1) of the files. The middle
of the box is the mean. So the average file size in the FitNesse project is
about 65 lines, and about one-third of the files are between 40 and 100+
lines. The largest file in FitNesse is about 400 lines and the smallest is 6
lines. Note that this is a log scale, so the small difference in vertical position
implies a very large difference in absolute size.

1. The box shows sigma/2 above and below the mean. Yes, I know that the file length distribution is
not normal, and so the standard deviation is not mathematically precise. But we're not trying for
precision here. We're just trying to get a feel.

Figure 5-1 File length distributions LOG scale (box height = sigma)
Junit, FitNesse, and Time and Money are composed of relatively small files.
None are over 500 lines and most of those files are less than 200 lines.
Tomcat and Ant, on the other hand, have some files that are several
thousand lines long and close to half are over 200 lines.

What does that mean to us? It appears to be possible to build significant
systems (FitNesse is close to 50,000 lines) out of files that are typically 200
lines long, with an upper limit of 500. Although this should not be a hard
and fast rule, it should be considered very desirable. Small files are usually
easier to understand than large files are.

The Newspaper Metaphor

Think of a well-written newspaper article. You read it vertically. At the top
you expect a headline that will tell you what the story is about and allows
you to decide whether it is something you want to read. The first paragraph
gives you a synopsis of the whole story, hiding all the details while giving
you the broad-brush concepts. As you continue downward, the details
increase until you have all the dates, names, quotes, claims, and other
minutia.

We would like a source file to be like a newspaper article. The name should
be simple but explanatory. The name, by itself, should be sufficient to tell
us whether we are in the right module or not. The topmost parts of the
source file should provide the high-level concepts and algorithms. Detail
should increase as we move downward, until at the end we find the lowest
level functions and details in the source file.

A newspaper is composed of many articles; most are very small. Some are a
bit larger. Very few contain as much text as a page can hold. This makes the
newspaper usable. If the newspaper were just one long story containing a
disorganized agglomeration of facts, dates, and names, then we simply
would not read it.

Vertical Openness Between Concepts

Nearly all code is read left to right and top to bottom. Each line represents
an expression or a clause, and each group of lines represents a complete
thought. Those thoughts should be separated from each other with blank
lines.

Consider, for example, Listing 5-1. There are blank lines that separate the
package declaration, the import(s), and each of the functions. This
extremely simple rule has a profound effect on the visual layout of the code.
Each blank line is a visual cue that identifies a new and separate concept.
As you scan down the listing, your eye is drawn to the first line that follows
a blank line.

Listing 5-1 BoldWidget.java

Click here to view code image

          package fitnesse.wikitext.widgets;

          import java.util.regex.*;

          public class BoldWidget extends ParentWidget {
              public static final String REGEXP = "'''.+?'''";
              private static final Pattern pattern =

     Pattern.compile("'''(.+?)'''",
                  Pattern.MULTILINE + Pattern.DOTALL

              );

              public BoldWidget(ParentWidget parent, String text) throws
     Exception {

                  super(parent);
                  Matcher match = pattern.matcher(text);
                  match.find();
                  addChildWidgets(match.group(1));
            }

            public String render() throws Exception {
                StringBuffer html = new StringBuffer("<b>");
                html.append(childHtml()).append("</b>");
                return html.toString();

          }

         }

Taking those blank lines out, as in Listing 5-2, has a remarkably obscuring
effect on the readability of the code.

Listing 5-2 BoldWidget.java

Click here to view code image

     package fitnesse.wikitext.widgets;                       throws
     import java.util.regex.*;
     public class BoldWidget extends ParentWidget {

         public static final String REGEXP = "'''.+?'''";
         private static final Pattern pattern =
Pattern.compile("'''(.+?)'''",

            Pattern.MULTILINE + Pattern.DOTALL);
         public BoldWidget(ParentWidget parent, String text)
Exception {

            super(parent);
            Matcher match = pattern.matcher(text);
            match.find();
            addChildWidgets(match.group(1));}
         public String render() throws Exception {
            StringBuffer html = new StringBuffer("<b>");
            html.append(childHtml()).append("</b>");
            return html.toString();
         }
     }

This effect is even more pronounced when you unfocus your eyes. In the
first example the different groupings of lines pop out at you, whereas the
second example looks like a muddle. The difference between these two
listings is a bit of vertical openness.

Vertical Density

If openness separates concepts, then vertical density implies close
association. So lines of code that are tightly related should appear vertically
dense. Notice how the useless comments in Listing 5-3 break the close
association of the two instance variables.

Listing 5-3

          public class ReporterConfig {

              /**
                * The class name of the reporter listener
                */

              private String m_className;

              /**
                * The properties of the reporter listener
                */

              private List<Property> m_properties = new
     ArrayList<Property>();

              public void addProperty(Property property) {
                  m_properties.add(property);

              }

Listing 5-4 is much easier to read. It fits in an "eye-full," or at least it does
for me. I can look at it and see that this is a class with two variables and a
method, without having to move my head or eyes much. The previous
listing forces me to use much more eye and head motion to achieve the
same level of comprehension.

Listing 5-4

          public class ReporterConfig {
              private String m_className;
              private List<Property> m_properties = new

     ArrayList<Property>();

              public void addProperty(Property property) {
                  m_properties.add(property);

              }

Vertical Distance

Have you ever chased your tail through a class, hopping from one function
to the next, scrolling up and down the source file, trying to divine how the
functions relate and operate, only to get lost in a rat's nest of confusion?
Have you ever hunted up the chain of inheritance for the definition of a
variable or function? This is frustrating because you are trying to
understand what the system does, but you are spending your time and
mental energy on trying to locate and remember where the pieces are.

Concepts that are closely related should be kept vertically close to each
other [G10]. Clearly this rule doesn't work for concepts that belong in
separate files. But then closely related concepts should not be separated into
different files unless you have a very good reason. Indeed, this is one of the
reasons that protected variables should be avoided.

For those concepts that are so closely related that they belong in the same
source file, their vertical separation should be a measure of how important
each is to the understandability of the other. We want to avoid forcing our
readers to hop around through our source files and classes.

Variable Declarations. Variables should be declared as close to their usage
as possible. Because our functions are very short, local variables should
appear at the top of each function, as in this longish function from
Junit4.3.1.

          private static void readPreferences() {
              InputStream is= null;
              try {
                  is= new FileInputStream(getPreferencesFile());
                  setPreferences(new Properties(getPreferences()));
                  getPreferences().load(is);
              } catch (IOException e) {
                  try {
                     if (is != null)
                         is.close();
                  } catch (IOException e1) {
                  }
              }

         }

Control variables for loops should usually be declared within the loop
statement, as in this cute little function from the same source.

Click here to view code image

          public int countTestCases() {
              int count= 0;
   for (Test each : tests)
       count += each.countTestCases();

   return count;
}

In rare cases a variable might be declared at the top of a block or just before
a loop in a long-ish function. You can see such a variable in this snippet
from the midst of a very long function in TestNG.

Click here to view code image

     ...  (XmlTest test : m_suite.getTests()) {
     for     TestRunner tr = m_runnerFactory.newTestRunner(this,

test);       tr.addListener(m_textReporter);
             m_testRunners.add(tr);

          invoker = tr.getInvoker();

          for (ITestNGMethod m : tr.getBeforeSuiteMethods()) {
             beforeSuiteMethods.put(m.getMethod(), m);

          }

       for (ITestNGMethod m : tr.getAfterSuiteMethods()) {
          afterSuiteMethods.put(m.getMethod(), m);

       }
   }
...

Instance variables, on the other hand, should be declared at the top of the
class. This should not increase the vertical distance of these variables,
because in a well-designed class, they are used by many, if not all, of the
methods of the class.

There have been many debates over where instance variables should go. In
C++ we commonly practiced the so-called scissors rule, which put all the
instance variables at the bottom. The common convention in Java, however,
is to put them all at the top of the class. I see no reason to follow any other
convention. The important thing is for the instance variables to be declared
in one well-known place. Everybody should know where to go to see the
declarations.

Consider, for example, the strange case of the TestSuite class in JUnit
4.3.1. I have greatly attenuated this class to make the point. If you look
about halfway down the listing, you will see two instance variables declared
there. It would be hard to hide them in a better place. Someone reading this
code would have to stumble across the declarations by accident (as I did).

     public class TestSuite implements Test {                                TestCase>
         static public Test createTest(Class<? extends

theClass,
                                                             String name) {

            ...
         }

public static Constructor<? extends TestCase>
getTestConstructor(Class<? extends TestCase> theClass)
throws NoSuchMethodException {

   ...
}

public static Test warning(final String message) {
   ...

}

private static String exceptionToString(Throwable t) {
   ...

}

private String fName;

private Vector<Test> fTests= new Vector<Test>(10);

public TestSuite() {
}

          public TestSuite(final Class<? extends TestCase> theClass)
{

              ...
         }

         public TestSuite(Class<?  extends  TestCase>  theClass,
String name) {

            ...
         }
         ... ... ... ... ...
   }

Dependent Functions. If one function calls another, they should be
vertically close, and the caller should be above the callee, if at all possible.
This gives the program a natural flow. If the convention is followed reliably,
readers will be able to trust that function definitions will follow shortly after
their use. Consider, for example, the snippet from FitNesse in Listing 5-5.
Notice how the topmost function calls those below it and how they in turn
call those below them. This makes it easy to find the called functions and
greatly enhances the readability of the whole module.

Listing 5-5 WikiPageResponder.java

Click here to view code image

          public class WikiPageResponder implements SecureResponder {
              protected WikiPage page;
              protected PageData pageData;
              protected String pageTitle;
              protected Request request;
              protected PageCrawler crawler;

         public Response makeResponse(FitNesseContext context,
Request request)

            throws Exception {
            String pageName = getPageNameOrDefault(request,
"FrontPage");
            loadPage(pageName, context);
            if (page == null)

                return notFoundResponse(context, request);
            else

                return makePageResponse(context);
         }

         private String getPageNameOrDefault(Request  request,  String
defaultPageName)

         {
            String pageName = request.getResource();
            if (StringUtil.isBlank(pageName))
                pageName = defaultPageName;

   return pageName;
}

         protected void loadPage(String resource, FitNesseContext
context)

            throws Exception {
            WikiPagePath path = PathParser.parse(resource);
            crawler = context.root.getPageCrawler();
            crawler.setDeadEndStrategy(new
VirtualEnabledPageCrawler());
            page = crawler.getPage(context.root, path);
            if (page != null)

                pageData = page.getData();
         }
              private Response notFoundResponse(FitNesseContext context,
     Request request)

                  throws Exception {
                  return new NotFoundResponder().makeResponse(context,
     request);
              }

              private SimpleResponse makePageResponse(FitNesseContext
     context)

                  throws Exception {
                  pageTitle = PathParser.render(crawler.getFullPath(page));
                  String html = makeHtml(context);

                  SimpleResponse response = new SimpleResponse();
                  response.setMaxAge(0);
                  response.setContent(html);
                  return response;
              }
          ...

As an aside, this snippet provides a nice example of keeping constants at
the appropriate level [G35]. The "FrontPage" constant could have been
buried in the getPageNameOrDefault function, but that would have
hidden a well-known and expected constant in an inappropriately low-level
function. It was better to pass that constant down from the place where it
makes sense to know it to the place that actually uses it.

Conceptual Affinity. Certain bits of code want to be near other bits. They
have a certain conceptual affinity. The stronger that affinity, the less vertical
distance there should be between them.

As we have seen, this affinity might be based on a direct dependence, such
as one function calling another, or a function using a variable. But there are
other possible causes of affinity. Affinity might be caused because a group
of functions perform a similar operation. Consider this snippet of code from
Junit 4.3.1:
Click here to view code image

     public class Assert {                     message,  boolean
         static public void assertTrue(String

condition) {
            if (!condition)
                fail(message);

         }

static public void assertTrue(boolean condition) {
   assertTrue(null, condition);

}

         static public void assertFalse(String message, boolean
condition) {

            assertTrue(message, !condition);
         }

   static public void assertFalse(boolean condition) {
       assertFalse(null, condition);

   }
...

These functions have a strong conceptual affinity because they share a
common naming scheme and perform variations of the same basic task. The
fact that they call each other is secondary. Even if they didn't, they would
still want to be close together.

Vertical Ordering

In general we want function call dependencies to point in the downward
direction. That is, a function that is called should be below a function that
does the calling.2 This creates a nice flow down the source code module
from high level to low level.

2. This is the exact opposite of languages like Pascal, C, and C++ that enforce functions to be
defined, or at least declared, before they are used.
As in newspaper articles, we expect the most important concepts to come
first, and we expect them to be expressed with the least amount of polluting
detail. We expect the low-level details to come last. This allows us to skim
source files, getting the gist from the first few functions, without having to
immerse ourselves in the details. Listing 5-5 is organized this way. Perhaps
even better examples are Listing 15-5 on page 263, and Listing 3-7 on page
50.
Horizontal Formatting

How wide should a line be? To answer that, let's look at how wide lines are
in typical programs. Again, we examine the seven different projects. Figure
5-2 shows the distribution of line lengths of all seven projects. The
regularity is impressive, especially right around 45 characters. Indeed,
every size from 20 to 60 represents about 1 percent of the total number of
lines. That's 40 percent! Perhaps another 30 percent are less than 10
characters wide. Remember this is a log scale, so the linear appearance of
the drop-off above 80 characters is really very significant. Programmers
clearly prefer short lines.
Figure 5-2 Java line width distribution

This suggests that we should strive to keep our lines short. The old
Hollerith limit of 80 is a bit arbitrary, and I'm not opposed to lines edging
out to 100 or even 120. But beyond that is probably just careless.
I used to follow the rule that you should never have to scroll to the right.
But monitors are too wide for that nowadays, and younger programmers
can shrink the font so small that they can get 200 characters across the
screen. Don't do that. I personally set my limit at 120.

Horizontal Openness and Density

We use horizontal white space to associate things that are strongly related
and disassociate things that are more weakly related. Consider the following
function:

Click here to view code image

          private void measureLine(String line) {
              lineCount++;
              int lineSize = line.length();
              totalChars += lineSize;
              lineWidthHistogram.addLine(lineSize, lineCount);
              recordWidestLine(lineSize);

          }

I surrounded the assignment operators with white space to accentuate them.
Assignment statements have two distinct and major elements: the left side
and the right side. The spaces make that separation obvious.

On the other hand, I didn't put spaces between the function names and the
opening parenthesis. This is because the function and its arguments are
closely related. Separating them makes them appear disjoined instead of
conjoined. I separate arguments within the function call parenthesis to
accentuate the comma and show that the arguments are separate.

Another use for white space is to accentuate the precedence of operators.

Click here to view code image

          public class Quadratic {
              public static double root1(double a, double b, double c) {
                  double determinant = determinant(a, b, c);
                  return (-b + Math.sqrt(determinant)) / (2*a);
              }

              public static double root2(int a, int b, int c) {
                  double determinant = determinant(a, b, c);
                  return (-b - Math.sqrt(determinant)) / (2*a);

              }

              private static double determinant(double a, double b,
     double c) {

                  return b*b - 4*a*c;
              }
          }

Notice how nicely the equations read. The factors have no white space
between them because they are high precedence. The terms are separated by
white space because addition and subtraction are lower precedence.

Unfortunately, most tools for reformatting code are blind to the precedence
of operators and impose the same spacing throughout. So subtle spacings
like those shown above tend to get lost after you reformat the code.

Horizontal Alignment

When I was an assembly language programmer,3 I used horizontal
alignment to accentuate certain structures. When I started coding in C, C++,
and eventually Java, I continued to try to line up all the variable names in a
set of declarations, or all the rvalues in a set of assignment statements. My
code might have looked like this:

3. Who am I kidding? I still am an assembly language programmer. You can take the boy away from
the metal, but you can't take the metal out of the boy!

Click here to view code image

public class FitNesseExpediter implements ResponseSender

{

   private Socket        socket;

   private InputStream   input;

   private OutputStream  output;

   private Request       request;

   private Response      response;

   private FitNesseContext context;

   protected long        requestParsingTimeLimit;

   private long          requestProgress;

   private long          requestParsingDeadline;

   private boolean       hasError;

   public FitNesseExpediter(Socket      s,

                         FitNesseContext context)  throws

Exception

   {

      this.context =     context;

      socket =           s;

      input =            s.getInputStream();

      output =           s.getOutputStream();

      requestParsingTimeLimit = 10000;

   }
I have found, however, that this kind of alignment is not useful. The
alignment seems to emphasize the wrong things and leads my eye away
from the true intent. For example, in the list of declarations above you are
tempted to read down the list of variable names without looking at their
types. Likewise, in the list of assignment statements you are tempted to
look down the list of rvalues without ever seeing the assignment operator.
To make matters worse, automatic reformatting tools usually eliminate this
kind of alignment.

So, in the end, I don't do this kind of thing anymore. Nowadays I prefer
unaligned declarations and assignments, as shown below, because they
point out an important deficiency. If I have long lists that need to be
aligned, the problem is the length of the lists, not the lack of alignment. The
length of the list of declarations in FitNesseExpediter below suggests
that this class should be split up.

   private Socket socket;
   private InputStream input;
   private OutputStream output;
   private Request request;

private Response response;
private FitNesseContext context;
protected long requestParsingTimeLimit;
private long requestProgress;
private long requestParsingDeadline;
private boolean hasError;

         public FitNesseExpediter(Socket s,   FitNesseContext  context)
throws Exception

         {
            this.context = context;
            socket = s;
            input = s.getInputStream();
            output = s.getOutputStream();
            requestParsingTimeLimit = 10000;

         }

Indentation

A source file is a hierarchy rather like an outline. There is information that
pertains to the file as a whole, to the individual classes within the file, to the
methods within the classes, to the blocks within the methods, and
recursively to the blocks within the blocks. Each level of this hierarchy is a
scope into which names can be declared and in which declarations and
executable statements are interpreted.

To make this hierarchy of scopes visible, we indent the lines of source code
in proportion to their position in the hiearchy. Statements at the level of the
file, such as most class declarations, are not indented at all. Methods within
a class are indented one level to the right of the class. Implementations of
those methods are implemented one level to the right of the method
declaration. Block implementations are implemented one level to the right
of their containing block, and so on.

Programmers rely heavily on this indentation scheme. They visually line up
lines on the left to see what scope they appear in. This allows them to
quickly hop over scopes, such as implementations of if or while
statements, that are not relevant to their current situation. They scan the left
for new method declarations, new variables, and even new classes. Without
indentation, programs would be virtually unreadable by humans.

Consider the following programs that are syntactically and semantically
identical:

          public class FitNesseServer implements SocketServer { private
     FitNesseContext

          context; public FitNesseServer(FitNesseContext context) {
     this.context =

          context; } public void serve(Socket s) { serve(s, 10000); }
     public void

          serve(Socket s, long requestTimeout) { try {
     FitNesseExpediter sender = new

          FitNesseExpediter(s, context);
          sender.setRequestParsingTimeLimit(requestTimeout);
     sender.start(); }
          catch(Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }

          -----

          public class FitNesseServer implements SocketServer {
              private FitNesseContext context;
              public FitNesseServer(FitNesseContext context) {
                  this.context = context;
              }
              public void serve(Socket s) {
                  serve(s, 10000);

              }

              public void serve(Socket s, long requestTimeout) {
                  try {
                     FitNesseExpediter sender = new FitNesseExpediter(s,

     context);
                     sender.setRequestParsingTimeLimit(requestTimeout);
                     sender.start();

                  }
                  catch (Exception e) {

                     e.printStackTrace();
                  }
            }
         }

Your eye can rapidly discern the structure of the indented file. You can
almost instantly spot the variables, constructors, accessors, and methods. It
takes just a few seconds to realize that this is some kind of simple front end
to a socket, with a time-out. The unindented version, however, is virtually
impenetrable without intense study.

Breaking Indentation. It is sometimes tempting to break the indentation
rule for short if statements, short while loops, or short functions.
Whenever I have succumbed to this temptation, I have almost always gone
back and put the indentation back in. So I avoid collapsing scopes down to
one line like this:

Click here to view code image

          public class CommentWidget extends TextWidget
          {

              public static final String REGEXP = "^#[^\r\n]*(?:
     (?:\r\n)|\n|\r)?";

              public CommentWidget(ParentWidget parent, String text)
     {super(parent, text);}

              public String render() throws Exception {return ""; }
          }

I prefer to expand and indent the scopes instead, like this:

Click here to view code image

          public class CommentWidget extends TextWidget {
              public static final String REGEXP = "^#[^\r\n]*(?:

     (?:\r\n)|\n|\r)?"
              public CommentWidget(ParentWidget parent, String text) {
                  super(parent, text);

              }

              public String render() throws Exception {
                  return "";

              }
          }

Dummy Scopes

Sometimes the body of a while or for statement is a dummy, as shown
below. I don't like these kinds of structures and try to avoid them. When I
can't avoid them, I make sure that the dummy body is properly indented
and surrounded by braces. I can't tell you how many times I've been fooled
by a semicolon silently sitting at the end of a while loop on the same line.
Unless you make that semicolon visible by indenting it on it's own line, it's
just too hard to see.

Team Rules

The title of this section is a play on words. Every programmer has his own
favorite formatting rules, but if he works in a team, then the team rules.
A team of developers should agree upon a single formatting style, and then
every member of that team should use that style. We want the software to
have a consistent style. We don't want it to appear to have been written by a
bunch of disagreeing individuals.

When I started the FitNesse project back in 2002, I sat down with the team
to work out a coding style. This took about 10 minutes. We decided where
we'd put our braces, what our indent size would be, how we would name
classes, variables, and methods, and so forth. Then we encoded those rules
into the code formatter of our IDE and have stuck with them ever since.
These were not the rules that I prefer; they were rules decided by the team.
As a member of that team I followed them when writing code in the
FitNesse project.
Remember, a good software system is composed of a set of documents that
read nicely. They need to have a consistent and smooth style. The reader
needs to be able to trust that the formatting gestures he or she has seen in
one source file will mean the same thing in others. The last thing we want
to do is add more complexity to the source code by writing it in a jumble of
different individual styles.
Uncle Bob's Formatting Rules

The rules I use personally are very simple and are illustrated by the code in
Listing 5-6. Consider this an example of how code makes the best coding
standard document.

         private int totalChars;

         public CodeAnalyzer() {

         public static List<File> findJavaFiles(File parentDirectory) {
            List<File> files = new ArrayList<File>();
            findJavaFiles(parentDirectory, files);
            return files;

         }

         private static void findJavaFiles(File parentDirectory,

            for (File file : parentDirectory.listFiles()) {

       Integer[] sortedWidths = (widths.toArray(new Integer[0]));
       Arrays.sort(sortedWidths);
       return sortedWidths;
   }
}
Objects and Data Structures

There is a reason that we keep our variables private. We don't want anyone
else to depend on them. We want to keep the freedom to change their type
or implementation on a whim or an impulse. Why, then, do so many
programmers automatically add getters and setters to their objects, exposing
their private variables as if they were public?
Data Abstraction

Consider the difference between Listing 6-1 and Listing 6-2. Both represent
the data of a point on the Cartesian plane. And yet one exposes its
implementation and the other completely hides it.

Listing 6-1 Concrete Point

Click here to view code image

          public class Point {
              public double x;
              public double y;

          }

Listing 6-2 Abstract Point

Click here to view code image

          public interface Point {
              double getX();
              double getY();
              void setCartesian(double x, double y);
              double getR();
              double getTheta();
              void setPolar(double r, double theta);

          }

The beautiful thing about Listing 6-2 is that there is no way you can tell
whether the implementation is in rectangular or polar coordinates. It might
be neither! And yet the interface still unmistakably represents a data
structure.

But it represents more than just a data structure. The methods enforce an
access policy. You can read the individual coordinates independently, but
you must set the coordinates together as an atomic operation.

Listing 6-1, on the other hand, is very clearly implemented in rectangular
coordinates, and it forces us to manipulate those coordinates independently.
This exposes implementation. Indeed, it would expose implementation even
if the variables were private and we were using single variable getters and
setters.
Hiding implementation is not just a matter of putting a layer of functions
between the variables. Hiding implementation is about abstractions! A class
does not simply push its variables out through getters and setters. Rather it
exposes abstract interfaces that allow its users to manipulate the essence of
the data, without having to know its implementation.

Consider Listing 6-3 and Listing 6-4. The first uses concrete terms to
communicate the fuel level of a vehicle, whereas the second does so with
the abstraction of percentage. In the concrete case you can be pretty sure
that these are just accessors of variables. In the abstract case you have no
clue at all about the form of the data.

Listing 6-3 Concrete Vehicle

Click here to view code image

          public interface Vehicle {
              double getFuelTankCapacityInGallons();
              double getGallonsOfGasoline();

          }

Listing 6-4 Abstract Vehicle

Click here to view code image

          public interface Vehicle {
              double getPercentFuelRemaining();

          }

In both of the above cases the second option is preferable. We do not want
to expose the details of our data. Rather we want to express our data in
abstract terms. This is not merely accomplished by using interfaces and/or
getters and setters. Serious thought needs to be put into the best way to
represent the data that an object contains. The worst option is to blithely
add getters and setters.
Data/Object Anti-Symmetry

These two examples show the difference between objects and data
structures. Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions
that operate on that data. Data structure expose their data and have no
meaningful functions. Go back and read that again. Notice the
complimentary nature of the two definitions. They are virtual opposites.
This difference may seem trivial, but it has far-reaching implications.

Consider, for example, the procedural shape example in Listing 6-5. The
Geometry class operates on the three shape classes. The shape classes are
simple data structures without any behavior. All the behavior is in the
Geometry class.

Listing 6-5 Procedural Shape

Click here to view code image

          public class Square {
              public Point topLeft;
              public double side;

          }

public class Rectangle {
   public Point topLeft;
   public double height;
   public double width;

}

public class Circle {
   public Point center;
   public double radius;

}

public class Geometry {
   public final double PI = 3.141592653589793;

         public double area(Object shape)   throws
NoSuchShapeException

         {
            if (shape instanceof Square) {
                Square s = (Square)shape;
                return s.side * s.side;
            }
                  else if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
                     Rectangle r = (Rectangle)shape;
                     return r.height * r.width;

                  }
                  else if (shape instanceof Circle) {

                     Circle c = (Circle)shape;
                     return PI * c.radius * c.radius;
                  }
                  throw new NoSuchShapeException();
              }
          }

Object-oriented programmers might wrinkle their noses at this and
complain that it is procedural--and they'd be right. But the sneer may not
be warranted. Consider what would happen if a perimeter() function
were added to Geometry. The shape classes would be unaffected! Any
other classes that depended upon the shapes would also be unaffected! On
the other hand, if I add a new shape, I must change all the functions in
Geometry to deal with it. Again, read that over. Notice that the two
conditions are diametrically opposed.

Now consider the object-oriented solution in Listing 6-6. Here the area()
method is polymorphic. No Geometry class is necessary. So if I add a
new shape, none of the existing functions are affected, but if I add a new
function all of the shapes must be changed!1

1. There are ways around this that are well known to experienced object-oriented designers:
VISITOR, or dual-dispatch, for example. But these techniques carry costs of their own and generally
return the structure to that of a procedural program.

Listing 6-6 Polymorphic Shapes

Click here to view code image

          public class Square implements Shape {
              private Point topLeft;
              private double side;

              public double area() {
                  return side*side;

              }
          }

          public class Rectangle implements Shape {
              private Point topLeft;
              private double height;
              private double width;
              public double area() {
                  return height * width;

              }
          }

              public class Circle implements Shape {
                  private Point center;
                  private double radius;
                  public final double PI = 3.141592653589793;

                  public double area() {
                     return PI * radius * radius;

                  }
          }

Again, we see the complementary nature of these two definitions; they are
virtual opposites! This exposes the fundamental dichotomy between objects
and data structures:

         Procedural code (code using data structures) makes it easy to add
         new functions without changing the existing data structures. OO
         code, on the other hand, makes it easy to add new classes without
         changing existing functions.

The complement is also true:

         Procedural code makes it hard to add new data structures because
         all the functions must change. OO code makes it hard to add new
         functions because all the classes must change.

So, the things that are hard for OO are easy for procedures, and the things
that are hard for procedures are easy for OO!

In any complex system there are going to be times when we want to add
new data types rather than new functions. For these cases objects and OO
are most appropriate. On the other hand, there will also be times when we'll
want to add new functions as opposed to data types. In that case procedural
code and data structures will be more appropriate.

Mature programmers know that the idea that everything is an object is a
myth. Sometimes you really do want simple data structures with procedures
operating on them.
The Law of Demeter

There is a well-known heuristic called the Law of Demeter2 that says a
module should not know about the innards of the objects it manipulates. As
we saw in the last section, objects hide their data and expose operations.
This means that an object should not expose its internal structure through
accessors because to do so is to expose, rather than to hide, its internal
structure.

2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter

More precisely, the Law of Demeter says that a method f of a class C should
only call the methods of these:

      � C

      � An object created by f

      � An object passed as an argument to f

      � An object held in an instance variable of C

The method should not invoke methods on objects that are returned by any
of the allowed functions. In other words, talk to friends, not to strangers.

The following code3 appears to violate the Law of Demeter (among other
things) because it calls the getScratchDir() function on the return
value of getOptions() and then calls getAbsolutePath() on the
return value of getScratchDir().

3. Found somewhere in the apache framework.

          final String outputDir =
     ctxt.getOptions().getScratchDir().getAbsolutePath();

Train Wrecks

This kind of code is often called a train wreck because it look like a bunch
of coupled train cars. Chains of calls like this are generally considered to be
sloppy style and should be avoided [G36]. It is usually best to split them up
as follows:

Click here to view code image
          Options opts = ctxt.getOptions();
          File scratchDir = opts.getScratchDir();
          final String outputDir = scratchDir.getAbsolutePath();

Are these two snippets of code violations of the Law of Demeter? Certainly
the containing module knows that the ctxt object contains options, which
contain a scratch directory, which has an absolute path. That's a lot of
knowledge for one function to know. The calling function knows how to
navigate through a lot of different objects.

Whether this is a violation of Demeter depends on whether or not ctxt,
Options, and ScratchDir are objects or data structures. If they are
objects, then their internal structure should be hidden rather than exposed,
and so knowledge of their innards is a clear violation of the Law of
Demeter. On the other hand, if ctxt, Options, and ScratchDir are
just data structures with no behavior, then they naturally expose their
internal structure, and so Demeter does not apply.
The use of accessor functions confuses the issue. If the code had been
written as follows, then we probably wouldn't be asking about Demeter
violations.

Click here to view code image

          final String outputDir =
     ctxt.options.scratchDir.absolutePath;

This issue would be a lot less confusing if data structures simply had public
variables and no functions, whereas objects had private variables and public
functions. However, there are frameworks and standards (e.g., "beans") that
demand that even simple data structures have accessors and mutators.

Hybrids

This confusion sometimes leads to unfortunate hybrid structures that are
half object and half data structure. They have functions that do significant
things, and they also have either public variables or public accessors and
mutators that, for all intents and purposes, make the private variables
public, tempting other external functions to use those variables the way a
procedural program would use a data structure.4

4. This is sometimes called Feature Envy from [Refactoring].

Such hybrids make it hard to add new functions but also make it hard to add
new data structures. They are the worst of both worlds. Avoid creating
them. They are indicative of a muddled design whose authors are unsure of
--or worse, ignorant of--whether they need protection from functions or
types.

Hiding Structure

What if ctxt, options, and scratchDir are objects with real
behavior? Then, because objects are supposed to hide their internal
structure, we should not be able to navigate through them. How then would
we get the absolute path of the scratch directory?

Click here to view code image

          ctxt.getAbsolutePathOfScratchDirectoryOption();

or

Click here to view code image

          ctx.getScratchDirectoryOption().getAbsolutePath()

The first option could lead to an explosion of methods in the ctxt object.
The second presumes that getScratchDirectoryOption() returns a
data structure, not an object. Neither option feels good.

If ctxt is an object, we should be telling it to do something; we should not
be asking it about its internals. So why did we want the absolute path of the
scratch directory? What were we going to do with it? Consider this code
from (many lines farther down in) the same module:

Click here to view code image

          String outFile = outputDir + "/" + className.replace('.',
     '/') + ".class";

          FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(outFile);
          BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fout);
The admixture of different levels of detail [G34][G6] is a bit troubling.
Dots, slashes, file extensions, and File objects should not be so carelessly
mixed together, and mixed with the enclosing code. Ignoring that, however,
we see that the intent of getting the absolute path of the scratch directory
was to create a scratch file of a given name.

So, what if we told the ctxt object to do this?

Click here to view code image

          BufferedOutputStream bos =
     ctxt.createScratchFileStream(classFileName);

That seems like a reasonable thing for an object to do! This allows ctxt to
hide its internals and prevents the current function from having to violate
the Law of Demeter by navigating through objects it shouldn't know about.
Data Transfer Objects

The quintessential form of a data structure is a class with public variables
and no functions. This is sometimes called a data transfer object, or DTO.
DTOs are very useful structures, especially when communicating with
databases or parsing messages from sockets, and so on. They often become
the first in a series of translation stages that convert raw data in a database
into objects in the application code.

Somewhat more common is the "bean" form shown in Listing 6-7. Beans
have private variables manipulated by getters and setters. The quasiencapsulation of beans seems to make some OO purists feel better but
usually provides no other benefit.

              private String state;
              private String zip;

              public Address(String street, String streetExtra,
                                           String city, String state, String zip) {

                  this.street = street;
                  this.streetExtra = streetExtra;
                  this.city = city;
                  this.state = state;
                  this.zip = zip;
              }

              public String getStreet() {
                  return street;

              }

              public String getStreetExtra() {
                  return streetExtra;

              }

              public String getCity() {
                  return city;

              }
              public String getState() {
                  return state;

              }

            public String getZip() {
                return zip;

            }
          }

Active Record

Active Records are special forms of DTOs. They are data structures with
public (or bean-accessed) variables; but they typically have navigational
methods like save and find. Typically these Active Records are direct
translations from database tables, or other data sources.

Unfortunately we often find that developers try to treat these data structures
as though they were objects by putting business rule methods in them. This
is awkward because it creates a hybrid between a data structure and an
object.

The solution, of course, is to treat the Active Record as a data structure and
to create separate objects that contain the business rules and that hide their
internal data (which are probably just instances of the Active Record).
Conclusion

Objects expose behavior and hide data. This makes it easy to add new kinds
of objects without changing existing behaviors. It also makes it hard to add
new behaviors to existing objects. Data structures expose data and have no
significant behavior. This makes it easy to add new behaviors to existing
data structures but makes it hard to add new data structures to existing
functions.

In any given system we will sometimes want the flexibility to add new data
types, and so we prefer objects for that part of the system. Other times we
will want the flexibility to add new behaviors, and so in that part of the
system we prefer data types and procedures. Good software developers
understand these issues without prejudice and choose the approach that is
best for the job at hand.

Error Handling

                by Michael Feathers

It might seem odd to have a section about error handling in a book about
clean code. Error handling is just one of those things that we all have to do
when we program. Input can be abnormal and devices can fail. In short,
things can go wrong, and when they do, we as programmers are responsible
for making sure that our code does what it needs to do.

The connection to clean code, however, should be clear. Many code bases
are completely dominated by error handling. When I say dominated, I don't
mean that error handling is all that they do. I mean that it is nearly
impossible to see what the code does because of all of the scattered error
handling. Error handling is important, but if it obscures logic, it's wrong.

In this chapter I'll outline a number of techniques and considerations that
you can use to write code that is both clean and robust--code that handles
errors with grace and style.
Use Exceptions Rather Than Return Codes

Back in the distant past there were many languages that didn't have
exceptions. In those languages the techniques for handling and reporting
errors were limited. You either set an error flag or returned an error code
that the caller could check. The code in Listing 7-1 illustrates these
approaches.

Listing 7-1 DeviceController.java

Click here to view code image

          public class DeviceController {
              ...
              public void sendShutDown() {
                  DeviceHandle handle = getHandle(DEV1);
                  // Check the state of the device
                  if (handle != DeviceHandle.INVALID) {
                     // Save the device status to the record field
                     retrieveDeviceRecord(handle);
                     // If not suspended, shut down
                     if (record.getStatus() != DEVICE_SUSPENDED) {
                         pauseDevice(handle);
                         clearDeviceWorkQueue(handle);
                         closeDevice(handle);
                     } else {
                         logger.log("Device suspended. Unable to shut down");
                     }
                  } else {
                     logger.log("Invalid handle for: " + DEV1.toString());
                  }
              }
              ...

          }

The problem with these approaches is that they clutter the caller. The caller
must check for errors immediately after the call. Unfortunately, it's easy to
forget. For this reason it is better to throw an exception when you encounter
an error. The calling code is cleaner. Its logic is not obscured by error
handling.

Listing 7-2 shows the code after we've chosen to throw exceptions in
methods that can detect errors.
Listing 7-2 DeviceController.java (with
exceptions)

Click here to view code image

          public class DeviceController {
              ...

              public void sendShutDown() {
                  try {
                     tryToShutDown();
                  } catch (DeviceShutDownError e) {
                     logger.log(e);
                  }

          }

            private void tryToShutDown() throws DeviceShutDownError {
                DeviceHandle handle = getHandle(DEV1);
                DeviceRecord record = retrieveDeviceRecord(handle);

                pauseDevice(handle);
                clearDeviceWorkQueue(handle);
                closeDevice(handle);
          }

              private DeviceHandle getHandle(DeviceID id) {
              ...
              throw new DeviceShutDownError("Invalid handle for: " +
     id.toString());
              ...
            }

            ...
          }

Notice how much cleaner it is. This isn't just a matter of aesthetics. The
code is better because two concerns that were tangled, the algorithm for
device shutdown and error handling, are now separated. You can look at
each of those concerns and understand them independently.
Write Your Try-Catch-Finally Statement First

One of the most interesting things about exceptions is that they define a
scope within your program. When you execute code in the try portion of a
try-catch-finally statement, you are stating that execution can abort
at any point and then resume at the catch.

In a way, try blocks are like transactions. Your catch has to leave your
program in a consistent state, no matter what happens in the try. For this
reason it is good practice to start with a try-catch-finally statement
when you are writing code that could throw exceptions. This helps you
define what the user of that code should expect, no matter what goes wrong
with the code that is executed in the try.

Let's look at an example. We need to write some code that accesses a file
and reads some serialized objects.

We start with a unit test that shows that we'll get an exception when the file
doesn't exist:

Click here to view code image

          @Test(expected = StorageException.class)
          public void retrieveSectionShouldThrowOnInvalidFileName() {

              sectionStore.retrieveSection("invalid - file");
          }

The test drives us to create this stub:

Click here to view code image

          public List<RecordedGrip> retrieveSection(String sectionName)
     {

              // dummy return until we have a real implementation
              return new ArrayList<RecordedGrip>();
          }

Our test fails because it doesn't throw an exception. Next, we change our
implementation so that it attempts to access an invalid file. This operation
throws an exception:

Click here to view code image

          public List<RecordedGrip> retrieveSection(String sectionName)
     {
              try {
                  FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(sectionName)

              } catch (Exception e) {
                  throw new StorageException("retrieval error", e);

              }
              return new ArrayList<RecordedGrip>();
          }

Our test passes now because we've caught the exception. At this point, we
can refactor. We can narrow the type of the exception we catch to match the
type that is actually thrown from the FileInputStream constructor:
FileNotFoundException:

Click here to view code image

          public List<RecordedGrip> retrieveSection(String sectionName)
     {

              try {
                  FileInputStream stream = new

     FileInputStream(sectionName);
                  stream.close();

              } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
                  throw new StorageException("retrieval error", e);

              }
              return new ArrayList<RecordedGrip>();
          }

Now that we've defined the scope with a try-catch structure, we can
use TDD to build up the rest of the logic that we need. That logic will be
added between the creation of the FileInputStream and the close,
and can pretend that nothing goes wrong.

Try to write tests that force exceptions, and then add behavior to your
handler to satisfy your tests. This will cause you to build the transaction
scope of the try block first and will help you maintain the transaction
nature of that scope.
Use Unchecked Exceptions

The debate is over. For years Java programmers have debated over the
benefits and liabilities of checked exceptions. When checked exceptions
were introduced in the first version of Java, they seemed like a great idea.
The signature of every method would list all of the exceptions that it could
pass to its caller. Moreover, these exceptions were part of the type of the
method. Your code literally wouldn't compile if the signature didn't match
what your code could do.

At the time, we thought that checked exceptions were a great idea; and yes,
they can yield some benefit. However, it is clear now that they aren't
necessary for the production of robust software. C# doesn't have checked
exceptions, and despite valiant attempts, C++ doesn't either. Neither do
Python or Ruby. Yet it is possible to write robust software in all of these
languages. Because that is the case, we have to decide--really--whether
checked exceptions are worth their price.

What price? The price of checked exceptions is an Open/Closed Principle1
violation. If you throw a checked exception from a method in your code and
the catch is three levels above, you must declare that exception in the
signature of each method between you and the catch. This means that a
change at a low level of the software can force signature changes on many
higher levels. The changed modules must be rebuilt and redeployed, even
though nothing they care about changed.

1. [Martin].

Consider the calling hierarchy of a large system. Functions at the top call
functions below them, which call more functions below them, ad infinitum.
Now let's say one of the lowest level functions is modified in such a way
that it must throw an exception. If that exception is checked, then the
function signature must add a throws clause. But this means that every
function that calls our modified function must also be modified either to
catch the new exception or to append the appropriate throws clause to its
signature. Ad infinitum. The net result is a cascade of changes that work
their way from the lowest levels of the software to the highest!
Encapsulation is broken because all functions in the path of a throw must
know about details of that low-level exception. Given that the purpose of
exceptions is to allow you to handle errors at a distance, it is a shame that
checked exceptions break encapsulation in this way.

Checked exceptions can sometimes be useful if you are writing a critical
library: You must catch them. But in general application development the
dependency costs outweigh the benefits.
Provide Context with Exceptions

Each exception that you throw should provide enough context to determine
the source and location of an error. In Java, you can get a stack trace from
any exception; however, a stack trace can't tell you the intent of the
operation that failed.

Create informative error messages and pass them along with your
exceptions. Mention the operation that failed and the type of failure. If you
are logging in your application, pass along enough information to be able to
log the error in your catch.
Define Exception Classes in Terms of a Caller's Needs

There are many ways to classify errors. We can classify them by their
source: Did they come from one component or another? Or their type: Are
they device failures, network failures, or programming errors? However,
when we define exception classes in an application, our most important
concern should be how they are caught.

Let's look at an example of poor exception classification. Here is a trycatch-finally statement for a third-party library call. It covers all of
the exceptions that the calls can throw:

Click here to view code image

          ACMEPort port = new ACMEPort(12);

          try {
              port.open();

          } catch (DeviceResponseException e) {
              reportPortError(e);
              logger.log("Device response exception", e);

          } catch (ATM1212UnlockedException e) {
              reportPortError(e);
              logger.log("Unlock exception", e);

          } catch (GMXError e) {
              reportPortError(e);
              logger.log("Device response exception");

          } finally {
              ...

          }

That statement contains a lot of duplication, and we shouldn't be surprised.
In most exception handling situations, the work that we do is relatively
standard regardless of the actual cause. We have to record an error and
make sure that we can proceed.

In this case, because we know that the work that we are doing is roughly the
same regardless of the exception, we can simplify our code considerably by
wrapping the API that we are calling and making sure that it returns a
common exception type:

Click here to view code image

          LocalPort port = new LocalPort(12);
          try {
              port.open();
          } catch (PortDeviceFailure e) {

              reportError(e);
              logger.log(e.getMessage(), e);
          } finally {
              ...
          }

Our LocalPort class is just a simple wrapper that catches and translates
exceptions thrown by the ACMEPort class:

Click here to view code image

          public class LocalPort {
              private ACMEPort innerPort;

              public LocalPort(int portNumber) {
                  innerPort = new ACMEPort(portNumber);

              }

              public void open() {
                  try {
                     innerPort.open();
                  } catch (DeviceResponseException e) {
                     throw new PortDeviceFailure(e);
                  } catch (ATM1212UnlockedException e) {
                     throw new PortDeviceFailure(e);
                  } catch (GMXError e) {
                     throw new PortDeviceFailure(e);
                  }

              }
              ...
          }

Wrappers like the one we defined for ACMEPort can be very useful. In
fact, wrapping third-party APIs is a best practice. When you wrap a thirdparty API, you minimize your dependencies upon it: You can choose to
move to a different library in the future without much penalty. Wrapping
also makes it easier to mock out third-party calls when you are testing your
own code.

One final advantage of wrapping is that you aren't tied to a particular
vendor's API design choices. You can define an API that you feel
comfortable with. In the preceding example, we defined a single exception
type for port device failure and found that we could write much cleaner
code.
Often a single exception class is fine for a particular area of code. The
information sent with the exception can distinguish the errors. Use different
classes only if there are times when you want to catch one exception and
allow the other one to pass through.
Define the Normal Flow

If you follow the advice in the preceding sections, you'll end up with a
good amount of separation between your business logic and your error
handling. The bulk of your code will start to look like a clean unadorned
algorithm. However, the process of doing this pushes error detection to the
edges of your program. You wrap external APIs so that you can throw your
own exceptions, and you define a handler above your code so that you can
deal with any aborted computation. Most of the time this is a great
approach, but there are some times when you may not want to abort.

Let's take a look at an example. Here is some awkward code that sums
expenses in a billing application:

Click here to view code image
          try {
              MealExpenses expenses =

     expenseReportDAO.getMeals(employee.getID());
              m_total += expenses.getTotal();

          } catch(MealExpensesNotFound e) {
              m_total += getMealPerDiem();

          }

In this business, if meals are expensed, they become part of the total. If they
aren't, the employee gets a meal per diem amount for that day. The
exception clutters the logic. Wouldn't it be better if we didn't have to deal
with the special case? If we didn't, our code would look much simpler. It
would look like this:

Click here to view code image
          MealExpenses expenses =

     expenseReportDAO.getMeals(employee.getID());
          m_total += expenses.getTotal();
Can we make the code that simple? It turns out that we can. We can change
the ExpenseReportDAO so that it always returns a MealExpense
object. If there are no meal expenses, it returns a MealExpense object
that returns the per diem as its total:

Click here to view code image

          public class PerDiemMealExpenses implements MealExpenses {
              public int getTotal() {
                  // return the per diem default
              }

          }

This is called the SPECIAL CASE PATTERN [Fowler]. You create a class or
configure an object so that it handles a special case for you. When you do,
the client code doesn't have to deal with exceptional behavior. That
behavior is encapsulated in the special case object.
Don't Return Null

I think that any discussion about error handling should include mention of
the things we do that invite errors. The first on the list is returning null. I
can't begin to count the number of applications I've seen in which nearly
every other line was a check for null. Here is some example code:

Click here to view code image

          public void registerItem(Item item) {
              if (item != null) {
                  ItemRegistry registry = peristentStore.getItemRegistry();
                  if (registry != null) {
                     Item existing = registry.getItem(item.getID());
                     if (existing.getBillingPeriod().hasRetailOwner()) {
                         existing.register(item);
                     }
                  }
              }

          }

If you work in a code base with code like this, it might not look all that bad
to you, but it is bad! When we return null, we are essentially creating
work for ourselves and foisting problems upon our callers. All it takes is
one missing null check to send an application spinning out of control.

Did you notice the fact that there wasn't a null check in the second line of
that nested if statement? What would have happened at runtime if
persistentStore were null? We would have had a
NullPointerException at runtime, and either someone is catching
NullPointerException at the top level or they are not. Either way
it's bad. What exactly should you do in response to a
NullPointerException thrown from the depths of your application?

It's easy to say that the problem with the code above is that it is missing a
null check, but in actuality, the problem is that it has too many. If you are
tempted to return null from a method, consider throwing an exception or
returning a SPECIAL CASE object instead. If you are calling a nullreturning method from a third-party API, consider wrapping that method
with a method that either throws an exception or returns a special case
object.
In many cases, special case objects are an easy remedy. Imagine that you
have code like this:

Click here to view code image

          List<Employee> employees = getEmployees();
          if (employees != null) {

              for(Employee e : employees) {
                  totalPay += e.getPay();

              }
          }

Right now, getEmployees can return null, but does it have to? If we
change getEmployee so that it returns an empty list, we can clean up the
code:

Click here to view code image

          List<Employee> employees = getEmployees();
          for(Employee e : employees) {

              totalPay += e.getPay();
          }

Fortunately, Java has Collections.emptyList(), and it returns a
predefined immutable list that we can use for this purpose:

Click here to view code image

          public List<Employee> getEmployees() {
              if( .. there are no employees .. )
                  return Collections.emptyList();

          }

If you code this way, you will minimize the chance of
NullPointerExceptions and your code will be cleaner.
Don't Pass Null

Returning null from methods is bad, but passing null into methods is
worse. Unless you are working with an API which expects you to pass
null, you should avoid passing null in your code whenever possible.

Let's look at an example to see why. Here is a simple method which
calculates a metric for two points:

Click here to view code image

          public class MetricsCalculator
          {

              public double xProjection(Point p1, Point p2) {
                  return (p2.x - p1.x) * 1.5;

              }
              ...
          }

What happens when someone passes null as an argument?

Click here to view code image

          calculator.xProjection(null, new Point(12, 13));

We'll get a NullPointerException, of course.

How can we fix it? We could create a new exception type and throw it:

Click here to view code image

          public class MetricsCalculator
          {

            public double xProjection(Point p1, Point p2) {
                if (p1 == null || p2 == null) {
                     throw InvalidArgumentException(
                         "Invalid argument for

     MetricsCalculator.xProjection");
                }
                return (p2.x - p1.x) * 1.5;

            }
          }

Is this better? It might be a little better than a null pointer exception, but
remember, we have to define a handler for
InvalidArgumentException. What should the handler do? Is there
any good course of action?
There is another alternative. We could use a set of assertions:

Click here to view code image

          public class MetricsCalculator
          {

              public double xProjection(Point p1, Point p2) {
                  assert p1 != null : "p1 should not be null";
                  assert p2 != null : "p2 should not be null";
                  return (p2.x - p1.x) * 1.5;

              }
          }

It's good documentation, but it doesn't solve the problem. If someone
passes null, we'll still have a runtime error.

In most programming languages there is no good way to deal with a null
that is passed by a caller accidentally. Because this is the case, the rational
approach is to forbid passing null by default. When you do, you can code
with the knowledge that a null in an argument list is an indication of a
problem, and end up with far fewer careless mistakes.
Conclusion

Clean code is readable, but it must also be robust. These are not conflicting
goals. We can write robust clean code if we see error handling as a separate
concern, something that is viewable independently of our main logic. To the
degree that we are able to do that, we can reason about it independently, and
we can make great strides in the maintainability of our code.

Boundaries

            by James Grenning

We seldom control all the software in our systems. Sometimes we buy
third-party packages or use open source. Other times we depend on teams in
our own company to produce components or subsystems for us. Somehow
we must cleanly integrate this foreign code with our own. In this chapter we
look at practices and techniques to keep the boundaries of our software
clean.
Using Third-Party Code

There is a natural tension between the provider of an interface and the user
of an interface. Providers of third-party packages and frameworks strive for
broad applicability so they can work in many environments and appeal to a
wide audience. Users, on the other hand, want an interface that is focused
on their particular needs. This tension can cause problems at the boundaries
of our systems.

Let's look at java.util.Map as an example. As you can see by
examining Figure 8-1, Maps have a very broad interface with plenty of
capabilities. Certainly this power and flexibility is useful, but it can also be
a liability. For instance, our application might build up a Map and pass it
around. Our intention might be that none of the recipients of our Map delete
anything in the map. But right there at the top of the list is the clear()
method. Any user of the Map has the power to clear it. Or maybe our design
convention is that only particular types of objects can be stored in the Map,
but Maps do not reliably constrain the types of objects placed within them.
Any determined user can add items of any type to any Map.

Figure 8-1 The methods of Map
If our application needs a Map of Sensors, you might find the sensors set
up like this:

          Map sensors = new HashMap();

Then, when some other part of the code needs to access the sensor, you see
this code:

Click here to view code image

          Sensor s = (Sensor)sensors.get(sensorId );
We don't just see it once, but over and over again throughout the code. The
client of this code carries the responsibility of getting an Object from the
Map and casting it to the right type. This works, but it's not clean code.
Also, this code does not tell its story as well as it could. The readability of
this code can be greatly improved by using generics, as shown below:

Click here to view code image

                  Map<Sensor> sensors = new HashMap<Sensor>();
          ...

                  Sensor s = sensors.get(sensorId );

However, this doesn't solve the problem that Map<Sensor> provides
more capability than we need or want.

Passing an instance of Map<Sensor> liberally around the system means
that there will be a lot of places to fix if the interface to Map ever changes.
You might think such a change to be unlikely, but remember that it changed
when generics support was added in Java 5. Indeed, we've seen systems
that are inhibited from using generics because of the sheer magnitude of
changes needed to make up for the liberal use of Maps.

A cleaner way to use Map might look like the following. No user of
Sensors would care one bit if generics were used or not. That choice has
become (and always should be) an implementation detail.

Click here to view code image

          public class Sensors {
              private Map sensors = new HashMap();

              public Sensor getById(String id) {
                  return (Sensor) sensors.get(id);

              }

              //snip
          }

The interface at the boundary (Map) is hidden. It is able to evolve with very
little impact on the rest of the application. The use of generics is no longer a
big issue because the casting and type management is handled inside the
Sensors class.

This interface is also tailored and constrained to meet the needs of the
application. It results in code that is easier to understand and harder to
misuse. The Sensors class can enforce design and business rules.

We are not suggesting that every use of Map be encapsulated in this form.
Rather, we are advising you not to pass Maps (or any other interface at a
boundary) around your system. If you use a boundary interface like Map,
keep it inside the class, or close family of classes, where it is used. Avoid
returning it from, or accepting it as an argument to, public APIs.
Exploring and Learning Boundaries

Third-party code helps us get more functionality delivered in less time.
Where do we start when we want to utilize some third-party package? It's
not our job to test the third-party code, but it may be in our best interest to
write tests for the third-party code we use.

Suppose it is not clear how to use our third-party library. We might spend a
day or two (or more) reading the documentation and deciding how we are
going to use it. Then we might write our code to use the third-party code
and see whether it does what we think. We would not be surprised to find
ourselves bogged down in long debugging sessions trying to figure out
whether the bugs we are experiencing are in our code or theirs.

Learning the third-party code is hard. Integrating the third-party code is
hard too. Doing both at the same time is doubly hard. What if we took a
different approach? Instead of experimenting and trying out the new stuff in
our production code, we could write some tests to explore our
understanding of the third-party code. Jim Newkirk calls such tests learning
tests.1

1. [BeckTDD], pp. 136-137.

In learning tests we call the third-party API, as we expect to use it in our
application. We're essentially doing controlled experiments that check our
understanding of that API. The tests focus on what we want out of the API.
Learning log4j

Let's say we want to use the apache log4j package rather than our own
custom-built logger. We download it and open the introductory
documentation page. Without too much reading we write our first test case,
expecting it to write "hello" to the console.

Click here to view code image

          @Test
          public void testLogCreate() {

              Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("MyLogger");
              logger.info("hello");
          }

When we run it, the logger produces an error that tells us we need
something called an Appender. After a little more reading we find that
there is a ConsoleAppender. So we create a ConsoleAppender and
see whether we have unlocked the secrets of logging to the console.

Click here to view code image

          @Test
          public void testLogAddAppender() {

              Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("MyLogger");
              ConsoleAppender appender = new ConsoleAppender();
              logger.addAppender(appender);
              logger.info("hello");
          }

This time we find that the Appender has no output stream. Odd--it seems
logical that it'd have one. After a little help from Google, we try the
following:

Click here to view code image

          @Test
          public void testLogAddAppender() {

              Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("MyLogger");
              logger.removeAllAppenders();
              logger.addAppender(new ConsoleAppender(

                       new PatternLayout("%p %t %m%n"),
                       ConsoleAppender.SYSTEM_OUT));
              logger.info("hello");
          }
That worked; a log message that includes "hello" came out on the console!
It seems odd that we have to tell the ConsoleAppender that it writes to
the console.

Interestingly enough, when we remove the
ConsoleAppender.SystemOut argument, we see that "hello" is still
printed. But when we take out the PatternLayout, it once again
complains about the lack of an output stream. This is very strange behavior.

Looking a little more carefully at the documentation, we see that the default
ConsoleAppender constructor is "unconfigured," which does not seem
too obvious or useful. This feels like a bug, or at least an inconsistency, in
log4j.

A bit more googling, reading, and testing, and we eventually wind up with
Listing 8-1. We've discovered a great deal about the way that log4j
works, and we've encoded that knowledge into a set of simple unit tests.

Listing 8-1 LogTest.java

Click here to view code image

          public class LogTest {
                  private Logger logger;

                  @Before
                  public void initialize() {

                         logger = Logger.getLogger("logger");
                         logger.removeAllAppenders();
                         Logger.getRootLogger().removeAllAppenders();
                  }

                  @Test
                  public void basicLogger() {

                         BasicConfigurator.configure();
                         logger.info("basicLogger");
                  }

                  @Test
                  public void addAppenderWithStream() {
                  logger.addAppender(new ConsoleAppender(

                         new PatternLayout("%p %t %m%n"),
                         ConsoleAppender.SYSTEM_OUT));
                       logger.info("addAppenderWithStream");
                  }
                  @Test
                  public void addAppenderWithoutStream() {

                   logger.addAppender(new ConsoleAppender(
                             new PatternLayout("%p %t %m%n")));

                         logger.info("addAppenderWithoutStream");
                  }
          }

Now we know how to get a simple console logger initialized, and we can
encapsulate that knowledge into our own logger class so that the rest of our
application is isolated from the log4j boundary interface.
Learning Tests Are Better Than Free

The learning tests end up costing nothing. We had to learn the API anyway,
and writing those tests was an easy and isolated way to get that knowledge.
The learning tests were precise experiments that helped increase our
understanding.

Not only are learning tests free, they have a positive return on investment.
When there are new releases of the third-party package, we run the learning
tests to see whether there are behavioral differences.

Learning tests verify that the third-party packages we are using work the
way we expect them to. Once integrated, there are no guarantees that the
third-party code will stay compatible with our needs. The original authors
will have pressures to change their code to meet new needs of their own.
They will fix bugs and add new capabilities. With each release comes new
risk. If the third-party package changes in some way incompatible with our
tests, we will find out right away.

Whether you need the learning provided by the learning tests or not, a clean
boundary should be supported by a set of outbound tests that exercise the
interface the same way the production code does. Without these boundary
tests to ease the migration, we might be tempted to stay with the old version
longer than we should.
Using Code That Does Not Yet Exist

There is another kind of boundary, one that separates the known from the
unknown. There are often places in the code where our knowledge seems to
drop off the edge. Sometimes what is on the other side of the boundary is
unknowable (at least right now). Sometimes we choose to look no farther
than the boundary.

A number of years back I was part of a team developing software for a
radio communications system. There was a subsystem, the "Transmitter,"
that we knew little about, and the people responsible for the subsystem had
not gotten to the point of defining their interface. We did not want to be
blocked, so we started our work far away from the unknown part of the
code.

We had a pretty good idea of where our world ended and the new world
began. As we worked, we sometimes bumped up against this boundary.
Though mists and clouds of ignorance obscured our view beyond the
boundary, our work made us aware of what we wanted the boundary
interface to be. We wanted to tell the transmitter something like this:

         Key the transmitter on the provided frequency and emit an analog
         representation of the data coming from this stream.

We had no idea how that would be done because the API had not been
designed yet. So we decided to work out the details later.

To keep from being blocked, we defined our own interface. We called it
something catchy, like Transmitter. We gave it a method called
transmit that took a frequency and a data stream. This was the interface
we wished we had.

One good thing about writing the interface we wish we had is that it's under
our control. This helps keep client code more readable and focused on what
it is trying to accomplish.

In Figure 8-2, you can see that we insulated the
CommunicationsController classes from the transmitter API
(which was out of our control and undefined). By using our own application
specific interface, we kept our CommunicationsController code
clean and expressive. Once the transmitter API was defined, we wrote the
TransmitterAdapter to bridge the gap. The ADAPTER2 encapsulated
the interaction with the API and provides a single place to change when the
API evolves.

2. See the Adapter pattern in [GOF].

Figure 8-2 Predicting the transmitter

This design also gives us a very convenient seam3 in the code for testing.
Using a suitable FakeTransmitter, we can test the
CommunicationsController classes. We can also create boundary
tests once we have the TransmitterAPI that make sure we are using the
API correctly.

3. See more about seams in [WELC].
Clean Boundaries

Interesting things happen at boundaries. Change is one of those things.
Good software designs accommodate change without huge investments and
rework. When we use code that is out of our control, special care must be
taken to protect our investment and make sure future change is not too
costly.

Code at the boundaries needs clear separation and tests that define
expectations. We should avoid letting too much of our code know about the
third-party particulars. It's better to depend on something you control than
on something you don't control, lest it end up controlling you.

We manage third-party boundaries by having very few places in the code
that refer to them. We may wrap them as we did with Map, or we may use
an ADAPTER to convert from our perfect interface to the provided interface.
Either way our code speaks to us better, promotes internally consistent
usage across the boundary, and has fewer maintenance points when the
third-party code changes.

Unit Tests

Our profession has come a long way in the last ten years. In 1997 no one
had heard of Test Driven Development. For the vast majority of us, unit
tests were short bits of throw-away code that we wrote to make sure our
programs "worked." We would painstakingly write our classes and
methods, and then we would concoct some ad hoc code to test them.
Typically this would involve some kind of simple driver program that
would allow us to manually interact with the program we had written.
I remember writing a C++ program for an embedded real-time system back
in the mid-90s. The program was a simple timer with the following
signature:

Click here to view code image

          void Timer::ScheduleCommand(Command* theCommand, int
     milliseconds)

The idea was simple; the execute method of the Command would be
executed in a new thread after the specified number of milliseconds. The
problem was, how to test it.

I cobbled together a simple driver program that listened to the keyboard.
Every time a character was typed, it would schedule a command that would
type the same character five seconds later. Then I tapped out a rhythmic
melody on the keyboard and waited for that melody to replay on the screen
five seconds later.

"I ... want-a-girl ... just ... like-the-girl-who-marr ... ied ... dear ... old ...
dad."

I actually sang that melody while typing the "." key, and then I sang it again
as the dots appeared on the screen.

That was my test! Once I saw it work and demonstrated it to my colleagues,
I threw the test code away.

As I said, our profession has come a long way. Nowadays I would write a
test that made sure that every nook and cranny of that code worked as I
expected it to. I would isolate my code from the operating system rather
than just calling the standard timing functions. I would mock out those
timing functions so that I had absolute control over the time. I would
schedule commands that set boolean flags, and then I would step the time
forward, watching those flags and ensuring that they went from false to true
just as I changed the time to the right value.

Once I got a suite of tests to pass, I would make sure that those tests were
convenient to run for anyone else who needed to work with the code. I
would ensure that the tests and the code were checked in together into the
same source package.
Yes, we've come a long way; but we have farther to go. The Agile and TDD
movements have encouraged many programmers to write automated unit
tests, and more are joining their ranks every day. But in the mad rush to add
testing to our discipline, many programmers have missed some of the more
subtle, and important, points of writing good tests.
The Three Laws of TDD

By now everyone knows that TDD asks us to write unit tests first, before
we write production code. But that rule is just the tip of the iceberg.
Consider the following three laws:1

1. Professionalism and Test-Driven Development, Robert C. Martin, Object Mentor, IEEE Software,
May/June 2007 (Vol. 24, No. 3) pp. 32-36

         http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MS.2007.85

First Law You may not write production code until you have written a
failing unit test.

Second Law You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail,
and not compiling is failing.

Third Law You may not write more production code than is sufficient to
pass the currently failing test.

These three laws lock you into a cycle that is perhaps thirty seconds long.
The tests and the production code are written together, with the tests just a
few seconds ahead of the production code.

If we work this way, we will write dozens of tests every day, hundreds of
tests every month, and thousands of tests every year. If we work this way,
those tests will cover virtually all of our production code. The sheer bulk of
those tests, which can rival the size of the production code itself, can
present a daunting management problem.
Keeping Tests Clean

Some years back I was asked to coach a team who had explicitly decided
that their test code should not be maintained to the same standards of
quality as their production code. They gave each other license to break the
rules in their unit tests. "Quick and dirty" was the watchword. Their
variables did not have to be well named, their test functions did not need to
be short and descriptive. Their test code did not need to be well designed
and thoughtfully partitioned. So long as the test code worked, and so long
as it covered the production code, it was good enough.

Some of you reading this might sympathize with that decision. Perhaps,
long in the past, you wrote tests of the kind that I wrote for that Timer
class. It's a huge step from writing that kind of throw-away test, to writing a
suite of automated unit tests. So, like the team I was coaching, you might
decide that having dirty tests is better than having no tests.

What this team did not realize was that having dirty tests is equivalent to, if
not worse than, having no tests. The problem is that tests must change as
the production code evolves. The dirtier the tests, the harder they are to
change. The more tangled the test code, the more likely it is that you will
spend more time cramming new tests into the suite than it takes to write the
new production code. As you modify the production code, old tests start to
fail, and the mess in the test code makes it hard to get those tests to pass
again. So the tests become viewed as an ever-increasing liability.

From release to release the cost of maintaining my team's test suite rose.
Eventually it became the single biggest complaint among the developers.
When managers asked why their estimates were getting so large, the
developers blamed the tests. In the end they were forced to discard the test
suite entirely.

But, without a test suite they lost the ability to make sure that changes to
their code base worked as expected. Without a test suite they could not
ensure that changes to one part of their system did not break other parts of
their system. So their defect rate began to rise. As the number of unintended
defects rose, they started to fear making changes. They stopped cleaning
their production code because they feared the changes would do more harm
than good. Their production code began to rot. In the end they were left
with no tests, tangled and bug-riddled production code, frustrated
customers, and the feeling that their testing effort had failed them.

In a way they were right. Their testing effort had failed them. But it was
their decision to allow the tests to be messy that was the seed of that failure.
Had they kept their tests clean, their testing effort would not have failed. I
can say this with some certainty because I have participated in, and
coached, many teams who have been successful with clean unit tests.

The moral of the story is simple: Test code is just as important as
production code. It is not a second-class citizen. It requires thought, design,
and care. It must be kept as clean as production code.

Tests Enable the -ilities

If you don't keep your tests clean, you will lose them. And without them,
you lose the very thing that keeps your production code flexible. Yes, you
read that correctly. It is unit tests that keep our code flexible, maintainable,
and reusable. The reason is simple. If you have tests, you do not fear
making changes to the code! Without tests every change is a possible bug.
No matter how flexible your architecture is, no matter how nicely
partitioned your design, without tests you will be reluctant to make changes
because of the fear that you will introduce undetected bugs.

But with tests that fear virtually disappears. The higher your test coverage,
the less your fear. You can make changes with near impunity to code that
has a less than stellar architecture and a tangled and opaque design. Indeed,
you can improve that architecture and design without fear!

So having an automated suite of unit tests that cover the production code is
the key to keeping your design and architecture as clean as possible. Tests
enable all the -ilities, because tests enable change.

So if your tests are dirty, then your ability to change your code is hampered,
and you begin to lose the ability to improve the structure of that code. The
dirtier your tests, the dirtier your code becomes. Eventually you lose the
tests, and your code rots.
Clean Tests

What makes a clean test? Three things. Readability, readability, and
readability. Readability is perhaps even more important in unit tests than it
is in production code. What makes tests readable? The same thing that
makes all code readable: clarity, simplicity, and density of expression. In a
test you want to say a lot with as few expressions as possible.

Consider the code from FitNesse in Listing 9-1. These three tests are
difficult to understand and can certainly be improved. First, there is a
terrible amount of duplicate code [G5] in the repeated calls to addPage
and assertSubString. More importantly, this code is just loaded with
details that interfere with the expressiveness of the test.

              assertSubString("<Test", xml);
          }

For example, look at the PathParser calls. They transform strings into
PagePath instances used by the crawlers. This transformation is
completely irrelevant to the test at hand and serves only to obfuscate the
intent. The details surrounding the creation of the responder and the
gathering and casting of the response are also just noise. Then there's the
ham-handed way that the request URL is built from a resource and an
argument. (I helped write this code, so I feel free to roundly criticize it.)

In the end, this code was not designed to be read. The poor reader is
inundated with a swarm of details that must be understood before the tests
make any real sense.

Now consider the improved tests in Listing 9-2. These tests do the exact
same thing, but they have been refactored into a much cleaner and more
explanatory form.

          public void testGetPageHierarchyAsXml() throws Exception {
              makePages("PageOne", "PageOne.ChildOne", "PageTwo");

submitRequest("root", "type:pages");

         assertResponseIsXML();      "<name>PageTwo</name>",
         assertResponseContains(

            "<name>PageOne</name>",
"<name>ChildOne</name>"

         );
     }

     public void testSymbolicLinksAreNotInXmlPageHierarchy()
throws Exception {

         WikiPage page = makePage("PageOne");
         makePages("PageOne.ChildOne", "PageTwo");

addLinkTo(page, "PageTwo", "SymPage");

submitRequest("root", "type:pages");

   assertResponseIsXML();
   assertResponseContains(

       "<name>PageOne</name>", "<name>PageTwo</name>",
                    "<name>ChildOne</name>"

   );
   assertResponseDoesNotContain("SymPage");
}

public void testGetDataAsXml() throws Exception {
   makePageWithContent("TestPageOne", "test page");
              submitRequest("TestPageOne", "type:data");

              assertResponseIsXML();
              assertResponseContains("test page", "<Test");
          }

The BUILD-OPERATE-CHECK2 pattern is made obvious by the structure of
these tests. Each of the tests is clearly split into three parts. The first part
builds up the test data, the second part operates on that test data, and the
third part checks that the operation yielded the expected results.

2. http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.AcceptanceTestPatterns

Notice that the vast majority of annoying detail has been eliminated. The
tests get right to the point and use only the data types and functions that
they truly need. Anyone who reads these tests should be able to work out
what they do very quickly, without being misled or overwhelmed by details.

Domain-Specific Testing Language

The tests in Listing 9-2 demonstrate the technique of building a domainspecific language for your tests. Rather than using the APIs that
programmers use to manipulate the system, we build up a set of functions
and utilities that make use of those APIs and that make the tests more
convenient to write and easier to read. These functions and utilities become
a specialized API used by the tests. They are a testing language that
programmers use to help themselves to write their tests and to help those
who must read those tests later on.

This testing API is not designed up front; rather it evolves from the
continued refactoring of test code that has gotten too tainted by obfuscating
detail. Just as you saw me refactor Listing 9-1 into Listing 9-2, so too will
disciplined developers refactor their test code into more succinct and
expressive forms.

A Dual Standard

In one sense the team I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter had
things right. The code within the testing API does have a different set of
engineering standards than production code. It must still be simple,
succinct, and expressive, but it need not be as efficient as production code.
After all, it runs in a test environment, not a production environment, and
those two environment have very different needs.

Consider the test in Listing 9-3. I wrote this test as part of an environment
control system I was prototyping. Without going into the details you can tell
that this test checks that the low temperature alarm, the heater, and the
blower are all turned on when the temperature is "way too cold."

Listing 9-3 EnvironmentControllerTest.java

Click here to view code image

     @Test                                            throws
         public void turnOnLoTempAlarmAtThreashold()

Exception {
            hw.setTemp(WAY_TOO_COLD);
            controller.tic();
            assertTrue(hw.heaterState());
            assertTrue(hw.blowerState());
            assertFalse(hw.coolerState());
            assertFalse(hw.hiTempAlarm());
            assertTrue(hw.loTempAlarm());

         }

There are, of course, lots of details here. For example, what is that tic
function all about? In fact, I'd rather you not worry about that while reading
this test. I'd rather you just worry about whether you agree that the end state
of the system is consistent with the temperature being "way too cold."

Notice, as you read the test, that your eye needs to bounce back and forth
between the name of the state being checked, and the sense of the state
being checked. You see heaterState, and then your eyes glissade left to
assertTrue. You see coolerState and your eyes must track left to
assertFalse. This is tedious and unreliable. It makes the test hard to
read.

I improved the reading of this test greatly by transforming it into Listing 94.

Listing 9-4 EnvironmentControllerTest.java
(refactored)

Click here to view code image
          @Test
              public void turnOnLoTempAlarmAtThreshold() throws Exception

     {
                  wayTooCold();
                  assertEquals("HBchL", hw.getState());

              }

Of course I hid the detail of the tic function by creating a wayTooCold
function. But the thing to note is the strange string in the assertEquals.
Upper case means "on," lower case means "off," and the letters are always
in the following order: {heater, blower, cooler, hi-tempalarm, lo-temp-alarm}.

Even though this is close to a violation of the rule about mental mapping,3 it
seems appropriate in this case. Notice, once you know the meaning, your
eyes glide across that string and you can quickly interpret the results.
Reading the test becomes almost a pleasure. Just take a look at Listing 9-5
and see how easy it is to understand these tests.

3. "Avoid Mental Mapping" on page 25.

Listing 9-5 EnvironmentControllerTest.java (bigger

          @Test
          public void turnOnCoolerAndBlowerIfTooHot() throws Exception
     {

              tooHot();
              assertEquals("hBChl", hw.getState());
          }

          @Test
          public void turnOnHeaterAndBlowerIfTooCold() throws Exception
     {

              tooCold();
              assertEquals("HBchl", hw.getState());
          }

          @Test
          public void turnOnHiTempAlarmAtThreshold() throws Exception {

              wayTooHot();
              assertEquals("hBCHl", hw.getState());
          }
          @Test
          public void turnOnLoTempAlarmAtThreshold() throws Exception {
              wayTooCold();
              assertEquals("HBchL", hw.getState());
          }

The getState function is shown in Listing 9-6. Notice that this is not
very efficient code. To make it efficient, I probably should have used a
StringBuffer.

Listing 9-6 MockControlHardware.java

Click here to view code image

public String getState() {       "h";
   String state = "";            "l";
   state += heater ? "H" : "h";
   state += blower ? "B" : "b";
   state += cooler ? "C" : "c";
   state += hiTempAlarm ? "H" :
   state += loTempAlarm ? "L" :
   return state;

}

StringBuffers are a bit ugly. Even in production code I will avoid them
if the cost is small; and you could argue that the cost of the code in Listing
9-6 is very small. However, this application is clearly an embedded realtime system, and it is likely that computer and memory resources are very
constrained. The test environment, however, is not likely to be constrained
at all.

That is the nature of the dual standard. There are things that you might
never do in a production environment that are perfectly fine in a test
environment. Usually they involve issues of memory or CPU efficiency.
But they never involve issues of cleanliness.
One Assert per Test

There is a school of thought4 that says that every test function in a JUnit test
should have one and only one assert statement. This rule may seem
draconian, but the advantage can be seen in Listing 9-5. Those tests come to
a single conclusion that is quick and easy to understand.

4. See Dave Astel's blog entry: http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=35578

But what about Listing 9-2? It seems unreasonable that we could somehow
easily merge the assertion that the output is XML and that it contains
certain substrings. However, we can break the test into two separate tests,
each with its own particular assertion, as shown in Listing 9-7.

Listing 9-7 SerializedPageResponderTest.java
(Single Assert)

Click here to view code image

          public void testGetPageHierarchyAsXml() throws Exception {
                  givenPages("PageOne", "PageOne.ChildOne", "PageTwo");

                  whenRequestIsIssued("root", "type:pages");

                  thenResponseShouldBeXML();
          }
          public void testGetPageHierarchyHasRightTags() throws
     Exception {

                  givenPages("PageOne", "PageOne.ChildOne", "PageTwo");

                  whenRequestIsIssued("root", "type:pages");

                  thenResponseShouldContain(
                     "<name>PageOne</name>", "<name>PageTwo</name>",

     "<name>ChildOne</name>"
                  );

          }

Notice that I have changed the names of the functions to use the common
given-when-then5 convention. This makes the tests even easier to read.
Unfortunately, splitting the tests as shown results in a lot of duplicate code.

5. [RSpec].
We can eliminate the duplication by using the TEMPLATE METHOD6 pattern
and putting the given/when parts in the base class, and the then parts in
different derivatives. Or we could create a completely separate test class
and put the given and when parts in the @Before function, and the when
parts in each @Test function. But this seems like too much mechanism for
such a minor issue. In the end, I prefer the multiple asserts in Listing 9-2.

6. [GOF].

I think the single assert rule is a good guideline.7 I usually try to create a
domain-specific testing language that supports it, as in Listing 9-5. But I am
not afraid to put more than one assert in a test. I think the best thing we can
say is that the number of asserts in a test ought to be minimized.

7. "Keep to the code!"

Single Concept per Test

Perhaps a better rule is that we want to test a single concept in each test
function. We don't want long test functions that go testing one
miscellaneous thing after another. Listing 9-8 is an example of such a test.
This test should be split up into three independent tests because it tests three
independent things. Merging them all together into the same function forces
the reader to figure out why each section is there and what is being tested
by that section.

Listing 9-8

Click here to view code image

          /**
          * Miscellaneous tests for the addMonths() method.
          */
          public void testAddMonths() {

                  SerialDate d1 = SerialDate.createInstance(31, 5, 2004);

                  SerialDate d2 = SerialDate.addMonths(1, d1);
                  assertEquals(30, d2.getDayOfMonth());
                  assertEquals(6, d2.getMonth());
                  assertEquals(2004, d2.getYYYY());

                  SerialDate d3 = SerialDate.addMonths(2, d1);
                  assertEquals(31, d3.getDayOfMonth());
                  assertEquals(7, d3.getMonth());
                  assertEquals(2004, d3.getYYYY());
                  SerialDate d4 = SerialDate.addMonths(1,
     SerialDate.addMonths(1, d1));

                  assertEquals(30, d4.getDayOfMonth());
                  assertEquals(7, d4.getMonth());
                  assertEquals(2004, d4.getYYYY());

          }

The three test functions probably ought to be like this:

   � Given the last day of a month with 31 days (like May):

      1. When you add one month, such that the last day of that month is the
         30th (like June), then the date should be the 30th of that month, not
         the 31st.

      2. When you add two months to that date, such that the final month has
         31 days, then the date should be the 31st.

   � Given the last day of a month with 30 days in it (like June):

      1. When you add one month such that the last day of that month has 31
         days, then the date should be the 30th, not the 31st.

Stated like this, you can see that there is a general rule hiding amidst the
miscellaneous tests. When you increment the month, the date can be no
greater than the last day of the month. This implies that incrementing the
month on February 28th should yield March 28th. That test is missing and
would be a useful test to write.

So it's not the multiple asserts in each section of Listing 9-8 that causes the
problem. Rather it is the fact that there is more than one concept being
tested. So probably the best rule is that you should minimize the number of
asserts per concept and test just one concept per test function.
F.I.R.S.T.8

8. Object Mentor Training Materials.

Clean tests follow five other rules that form the above acronym:

Fast Tests should be fast. They should run quickly. When tests run slow,
you won't want to run them frequently. If you don't run them frequently,
you won't find problems early enough to fix them easily. You won't feel as
free to clean up the code. Eventually the code will begin to rot.

Independent Tests should not depend on each other. One test should not set
up the conditions for the next test. You should be able to run each test
independently and run the tests in any order you like. When tests depend on
each other, then the first one to fail causes a cascade of downstream
failures, making diagnosis difficult and hiding downstream defects.

Repeatable Tests should be repeatable in any environment. You should be
able to run the tests in the production environment, in the QA environment,
and on your laptop while riding home on the train without a network. If
your tests aren't repeatable in any environment, then you'll always have an
excuse for why they fail. You'll also find yourself unable to run the tests
when the environment isn't available.

Self-Validating The tests should have a boolean output. Either they pass or
fail. You should not have to read through a log file to tell whether the tests
pass. You should not have to manually compare two different text files to
see whether the tests pass. If the tests aren't self-validating, then failure can
become subjective and running the tests can require a long manual
evaluation.

Timely The tests need to be written in a timely fashion. Unit tests should be
written just before the production code that makes them pass. If you write
tests after the production code, then you may find the production code to be
hard to test. You may decide that some production code is too hard to test.
You may not design the production code to be testable.
Conclusion

We have barely scratched the surface of this topic. Indeed, I think an entire
book could be written about clean tests. Tests are as important to the health
of a project as the production code is. Perhaps they are even more
important, because tests preserve and enhance the flexibility,
maintainability, and reusability of the production code. So keep your tests
constantly clean. Work to make them expressive and succinct. Invent testing
APIs that act as domain-specific language that helps you write the tests.

If you let the tests rot, then your code will rot too. Keep your tests clean.

Classes

         with Jeff Langr

So far in this book we have focused on how to write lines and blocks of
code well. We have delved into proper composition of functions and how
they interrelate. But for all the attention to the expressiveness of code
statements and the functions they comprise, we still don't have clean code
until we've paid attention to higher levels of code organization. Let's talk
about clean classes.
Class Organization

Following the standard Java convention, a class should begin with a list of
variables. Public static constants, if any, should come first. Then private
static variables, followed by private instance variables. There is seldom a
good reason to have a public variable.

Public functions should follow the list of variables. We like to put the
private utilities called by a public function right after the public function
itself. This follows the stepdown rule and helps the program read like a
newspaper article.

Encapsulation

We like to keep our variables and utility functions private, but we're not
fanatic about it. Sometimes we need to make a variable or utility function
protected so that it can be accessed by a test. For us, tests rule. If a test in
the same package needs to call a function or access a variable, we'll make it
protected or package scope. However, we'll first look for a way to maintain
privacy. Loosening encapsulation is always a last resort.
Classes Should Be Small!

The first rule of classes is that they should be small. The second rule of
classes is that they should be smaller than that. No, we're not going to
repeat the exact same text from the Functions chapter. But as with
functions, smaller is the primary rule when it comes to designing classes.
As with functions, our immediate question is always "How small?"

With functions we measured size by counting physical lines. With classes
we use a different measure. We count responsibilities.1

1. [RDD]

Listing 10-1 outlines a class, SuperDashboard, that exposes about 70
public methods. Most developers would agree that it's a bit too super in
size. Some developers might refer to SuperDashboard as a "God class."

But what if SuperDashboard contained only the methods shown in
Listing 10-2?

Listing 10-2 Small Enough?

Click here to view code image

          public class SuperDashboard extends JFrame implements
     MetaDataUser

                  public Component getLastFocusedComponent()
                  public void setLastFocused(Component lastFocused)
                  public int getMajorVersionNumber()
                  public int getMinorVersionNumber()
                  public int getBuildNumber()
          }

Five methods isn't too much, is it? In this case it is because despite its small
number of methods, SuperDashboard has too many responsibilities.

The name of a class should describe what responsibilities it fulfills. In fact,
naming is probably the first way of helping determine class size. If we
cannot derive a concise name for a class, then it's likely too large. The more
ambiguous the class name, the more likely it has too many responsibilities.
For example, class names including weasel words like Processor or
Manager or Super often hint at unfortunate aggregation of
responsibilities.

We should also be able to write a brief description of the class in about 25
words, without using the words "if," "and," "or," or "but." How would we
describe the SuperDashboard? "The SuperDashboard provides
access to the component that last held the focus, and it also allows us to
track the version and build numbers." The first "and" is a hint that
SuperDashboard has too many responsibilities.

The Single Responsibility Principle
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)2 states that a class or module
should have one, and only one, reason to change. This principle gives us
both a definition of responsibility, and a guidelines for class size. Classes
should have one responsibility--one reason to change.

2. You can read much more about this principle in [PPP].

The seemingly small SuperDashboard class in Listing 10-2 has two
reasons to change. First, it tracks version information that would seemingly
need to be updated every time the software gets shipped. Second, it
manages Java Swing components (it is a derivative of JFrame, the Swing
representation of a top-level GUI window). No doubt we'll want to update
the version number if we change any of the Swing code, but the converse
isn't necessarily true: We might change the version information based on
changes to other code in the system.

Trying to identify responsibilities (reasons to change) often helps us
recognize and create better abstractions in our code. We can easily extract
all three SuperDashboard methods that deal with version information
into a separate class named Version. (See Listing 10-3.) The Version
class is a construct that has a high potential for reuse in other applications!

SRP is one of the more important concept in OO design. It's also one of the
simpler concepts to understand and adhere to. Yet oddly, SRP is often the
most abused class design principle. We regularly encounter classes that do
far too many things. Why?

Getting software to work and making software clean are two very different
activities. Most of us have limited room in our heads, so we focus on
getting our code to work more than organization and cleanliness. This is
wholly appropriate. Maintaining a separation of concerns is just as
important in our programming activities as it is in our programs.
The problem is that too many of us think that we are done once the program
works. We fail to switch to the other concern of organization and
cleanliness. We move on to the next problem rather than going back and
breaking the overstuffed classes into decoupled units with single
responsibilities.

At the same time, many developers fear that a large number of small,
single-purpose classes makes it more difficult to understand the bigger
picture. They are concerned that they must navigate from class to class in
order to figure out how a larger piece of work gets accomplished.

However, a system with many small classes has no more moving parts than
a system with a few large classes. There is just as much to learn in the
system with a few large classes. So the question is: Do you want your tools
organized into toolboxes with many small drawers each containing welldefined and well-labeled components? Or do you want a few drawers that
you just toss everything into?

Every sizable system will contain a large amount of logic and complexity.
The primary goal in managing such complexity is to organize it so that a
developer knows where to look to find things and need only understand the
directly affected complexity at any given time. In contrast, a system with
larger, multipurpose classes always hampers us by insisting we wade
through lots of things we don't need to know right now.

To restate the former points for emphasis: We want our systems to be
composed of many small classes, not a few large ones. Each small class
encapsulates a single responsibility, has a single reason to change, and
collaborates with a few others to achieve the desired system behaviors.

Cohesion

Classes should have a small number of instance variables. Each of the
methods of a class should manipulate one or more of those variables. In
general the more variables a method manipulates the more cohesive that
method is to its class. A class in which each variable is used by each
method is maximally cohesive.

In general it is neither advisable nor possible to create such maximally
cohesive classes; on the other hand, we would like cohesion to be high.
When cohesion is high, it means that the methods and variables of the class
are co-dependent and hang together as a logical whole.

Consider the implementation of a Stack in Listing 10-4. This is a very
cohesive class. Of the three methods only size() fails to use both the
variables.

Listing 10-4 Stack.java A cohesive class.

          public class Stack {
              private int topOfStack = 0;
              List<Integer> elements = new LinkedList<Integer>();

              public int size() {
                  return topOfStack;

              }

              public void push(int element) {
                  topOfStack++;
                  elements.add(element);

              }

              public int pop() throws PoppedWhenEmpty {
                  if (topOfStack == 0)
                     throw new PoppedWhenEmpty();
                  int element = elements.get(--topOfStack);
                  elements.remove(topOfStack);
                  return element;

            }
          }

The strategy of keeping functions small and keeping parameter lists short
can sometimes lead to a proliferation of instance variables that are used by a
subset of methods. When this happens, it almost always means that there is
at least one other class trying to get out of the larger class. You should try to
separate the variables and methods into two or more classes such that the
new classes are more cohesive.

Maintaining Cohesion Results in Many Small Classes

Just the act of breaking large functions into smaller functions causes a
proliferation of classes. Consider a large function with many variables
declared within it. Let's say you want to extract one small part of that
function into a separate function. However, the code you want to extract
uses four of the variables declared in the function. Must you pass all four of
those variables into the new function as arguments?

Not at all! If we promoted those four variables to instance variables of the
class, then we could extract the code without passing any variables at all. It
would be easy to break the function up into small pieces.

Unfortunately, this also means that our classes lose cohesion because they
accumulate more and more instance variables that exist solely to allow a
few functions to share them. But wait! If there are a few functions that want
to share certain variables, doesn't that make them a class in their own right?
Of course it does. When classes lose cohesion, split them!

So breaking a large function into many smaller functions often gives us the
opportunity to split several smaller classes out as well. This gives our
program a much better organization and a more transparent structure.

As a demonstration of what I mean, let's use a time-honored example taken
from Knuth's wonderful book Literate Programming.3 Listing 10-5 shows a
translation into Java of Knuth's PrintPrimes program. To be fair to
Knuth, this is not the program as he wrote it but rather as it was output by
his WEB tool. I'm using it because it makes a great starting place for
breaking up a big function into many smaller functions and classes.

This program, written as a single function, is a mess. It has a deeply
indented structure, a plethora of odd variables, and a tightly coupled
structure. At the very least, the one big function should be split up into a
few smaller functions.

Listing 10-6 through Listing 10-8 show the result of splitting the code in
Listing 10-5 into smaller classes and functions, and choosing meaningful
names for those classes, functions, and variables.

The first thing you might notice is that the program got a lot longer. It went
from a little over one page to nearly three pages in length. There are several
reasons for this growth. First, the refactored program uses longer, more
descriptive variable names. Second, the refactored program uses function
and class declarations as a way to add commentary to the code. Third, we
used whitespace and formatting techniques to keep the program readable.

Notice how the program has been split into three main responsibilities. The
main program is contained in the PrimePrinter class all by itself. Its
responsibility is to handle the execution environment. It will change if the
method of invocation changes. For example, if this program were converted
to a SOAP service, this is the class that would be affected.

The RowColumnPagePrinter knows all about how to format a list of
numbers into pages with a certain number of rows and columns. If the
formatting of the output needed changing, then this is the class that would
be affected.

The PrimeGenerator class knows how to generate a list prime
numbers. Notice that it is not meant to be instantiated as an object. The
class is just a useful scope in which its variables can be declared and kept
hidden. This class will change if the algorithm for computing prime
numbers changes.

This was not a rewrite! We did not start over from scratch and write the
program over again. Indeed, if you look closely at the two different
programs, you'll see that they use the same algorithm and mechanics to get
their work done.

The change was made by writing a test suite that verified the precise
behavior of the first program. Then a myriad of tiny little changes were
made, one at a time. After each change the program was executed to ensure
that the behavior had not changed. One tiny step after another, the first
program was cleaned up and transformed into the second.
Organizing for Change

For most systems, change is continual. Every change subjects us to the risk
that the remainder of the system no longer works as intended. In a clean
system we organize our classes so as to reduce the risk of change.

The Sql class in Listing 10-9 is used to generate properly formed SQL
strings given appropriate metadata. It's a work in progress and, as such,
doesn't yet support SQL functionality like update statements. When the
time comes for the Sql class to support an update statement, we'll have
to "open up" this class to make modifications. The problem with opening a
class is that it introduces risk. Any modifications to the class have the
potential of breaking other code in the class. It must be fully retested.

Listing 10-9 A class that must be opened for change

Click here to view code image

          public class Sql {
                public Sql(String table, Column[] columns)
                public String create()
                public String insert(Object[] fields)
                public String selectAll()
                public String findByKey(String keyColumn, String keyValue)
                public String select(Column column, String pattern)
                public String select(Criteria criteria)
                public String preparedInsert()
                private String columnList(Column[] columns)
                private String valuesList(Object[] fields, final Column[]

     columns)
                private String selectWithCriteria(String criteria)
                private String placeholderList(Column[] columns)

          }

The Sql class must change when we add a new type of statement. It also
must change when we alter the details of a single statement type--for
example, if we need to modify the select functionality to support
subselects. These two reasons to change mean that the Sql class violates
the SRP.

We can spot this SRP violation from a simple organizational standpoint.
The method outline of Sql shows that there are private methods, such as
selectWithCriteria, that appear to relate only to select
statements.

Private method behavior that applies only to a small subset of a class can be
a useful heuristic for spotting potential areas for improvement. However,
the primary spur for taking action should be system change itself. If the
Sql class is deemed logically complete, then we need not worry about
separating the responsibilities. If we won't need update functionality for
the foreseeable future, then we should leave Sql alone. But as soon as we
find ourselves opening up a class, we should consider fixing our design.

What if we considered a solution like that in Listing 10-10? Each public
interface method defined in the previous Sql from Listing 10-9 is
refactored out to its own derivative of the Sql class. Note that the private
methods, such as valuesList, move directly where they are needed. The
common private behavior is isolated to a pair of utility classes, Where and
ColumnList.

          @Override public String generate()
          private String valuesList(Object[] fields, final

columns)
     }
public class SelectWithCriteriaSql extends Sql {
     public SelectWithCriteriaSql(
     String table, Column[] columns, Criteria criteria)
     @Override public String generate()

}

     public class SelectWithMatchSql extends Sql {              String
          public SelectWithMatchSql(
                String table, Column[] columns, Column column,

pattern)
          @Override public String generate()

     }

     public class FindByKeySql extends Sql       String  keyColumn,
          public FindByKeySql(
                String table, Column[] columns,

String keyValue)
          @Override public String generate()

     }

public class PreparedInsertSql extends Sql {
     public PreparedInsertSql(String table, Column[] columns)
          @Override public String generate() {
     private String placeholderList(Column[] columns)

}

public class Where {
     public Where(String criteria)
     public String generate()

}

public class ColumnList {
     public ColumnList(Column[] columns)
     public String generate()

}

The code in each class becomes excruciatingly simple. Our required
comprehension time to understand any class decreases to almost nothing.
The risk that one function could break another becomes vanishingly small.
From a test standpoint, it becomes an easier task to prove all bits of logic in
this solution, as the classes are all isolated from one another.

Equally important, when it's time to add the update statements, none of
the existing classes need change! We code the logic to build update
statements in a new subclass of Sql named UpdateSql. No other code in
the system will break because of this change.
Our restructured Sql logic represents the best of all worlds. It supports the
SRP. It also supports another key OO class design principle known as the
Open-Closed Principle, or OCP:4 Classes should be open for extension but
closed for modification. Our restructured Sql class is open to allow new
functionality via subclassing, but we can make this change while keeping
every other class closed. We simply drop our UpdateSql class in place.

4. [PPP].

We want to structure our systems so that we muck with as little as possible
when we update them with new or changed features. In an ideal system, we
incorporate new features by extending the system, not by making
modifications to existing code.

Isolating from Change

Needs will change, therefore code will change. We learned in OO 101 that
there are concrete classes, which contain implementation details (code), and
abstract classes, which represent concepts only. A client class depending
upon concrete details is at risk when those details change. We can introduce
interfaces and abstract classes to help isolate the impact of those details.

Dependencies upon concrete details create challenges for testing our
system. If we're building a Portfolio class and it depends upon an
external TokyoStockExchange API to derive the portfolio's value, our
test cases are impacted by the volatility of such a lookup. It's hard to write a
test when we get a different answer every five minutes!

Instead of designing Portfolio so that it directly depends upon
TokyoStockExchange, we create an interface, StockExchange, that
declares a single method:

Click here to view code image

          public interface StockExchange {
                Money currentPrice(String symbol);

          }

We design TokyoStockExchange to implement this interface. We also
make sure that the constructor of Portfolio takes a StockExchange
reference as an argument:

Click here to view code image
          public Portfolio {
                private StockExchange exchange;
                public Portfolio(StockExchange exchange) {
                     this.exchange = exchange;
                }

          // ...
          }

Now our test can create a testable implementation of the
StockExchange interface that emulates the TokyoStockExchange.
This test implementation will fix the current value for any symbol we use in
testing. If our test demonstrates purchasing five shares of Microsoft for our
portfolio, we code the test implementation to always return $100 per share
of Microsoft. Our test implementation of the StockExchange interface
reduces to a simple table lookup. We can then write a test that expects $500
for our overall portfolio value.

Click here to view code image

          public class PortfolioTest {
                private FixedStockExchangeStub exchange;
                private Portfolio portfolio;

                @Before
                protected void setUp() throws Exception {

                   exchange = new FixedStockExchangeStub();
                   exchange.fix("MSFT", 100);
                   portfolio = new Portfolio(exchange);
                }

                @Test
                public void GivenFiveMSFTTotalShouldBe500() throws
     Exception {

                   portfolio.add(5, "MSFT");
                   Assert.assertEquals(500, portfolio.value());
                }
          }

If a system is decoupled enough to be tested in this way, it will also be more
flexible and promote more reuse. The lack of coupling means that the
elements of our system are better isolated from each other and from change.
This isolation makes it easier to understand each element of the system.

By minimizing coupling in this way, our classes adhere to another class
design principle known as the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).5 In
essence, the DIP says that our classes should depend upon abstractions, not
on concrete details.

5. [PPP].

Instead of being dependent upon the implementation details of the
TokyoStock-Exchange class, our Portfolio class is now dependent
upon the StockExchange interface. The StockExchange interface
represents the abstract concept of asking for the current price of a symbol.
This abstraction isolates all of the specific details of obtaining such a price,
including from where that price is obtained.

Systems

         by Dr. Kevin Dean Wampler
"Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes
products difficult to plan, build, and test."
--Ray Ozzie, CTO, Microsoft Corporation
How Would You Build a City?

Could you manage all the details yourself? Probably not. Even managing an
existing city is too much for one person. Yet, cities work (most of the time).
They work because cities have teams of people who manage particular parts
of the city, the water systems, power systems, traffic, law enforcement,
building codes, and so forth. Some of those people are responsible for the
big picture, while others focus on the details.

Cities also work because they have evolved appropriate levels of
abstraction and modularity that make it possible for individuals and the
"components" they manage to work effectively, even without understanding
the big picture.

Although software teams are often organized like that too, the systems they
work on often don't have the same separation of concerns and levels of
abstraction. Clean code helps us achieve this at the lower levels of
abstraction. In this chapter let us consider how to stay clean at higher levels
of abstraction, the system level.
Separate Constructing a System from Using It

First, consider that construction is a very different process from use. As I
write this, there is a new hotel under construction that I see out my window
in Chicago. Today it is a bare concrete box with a construction crane and
elevator bolted to the outside. The busy people there all wear hard hats and
work clothes. In a year or so the hotel will be finished. The crane and
elevator will be gone. The building will be clean, encased in glass window
walls and attractive paint. The people working and staying there will look a
lot different too.

         Software systems should separate the startup process, when the
         application objects are constructed and the dependencies are
         "wired" together, from the runtime logic that takes over after
         startup.

The startup process is a concern that any application must address. It is the
first concern that we will examine in this chapter. The separation of
concerns is one of the oldest and most important design techniques in our
craft.

Unfortunately, most applications don't separate this concern. The code for
the startup process is ad hoc and it is mixed in with the runtime logic. Here
is a typical example:

Click here to view code image

          public Service getService() {
              if (service == null)
                  service = new MyServiceImpl(...); // Good enough default

     for most cases?
              return service;

          }

This is the LAZY INITIALIZATION/EVALUATION idiom, and it has several merits.
We don't incur the overhead of construction unless we actually use the
object, and our startup times can be faster as a result. We also ensure that
null is never returned.

However, we now have a hard-coded dependency on MyServiceImpl
and everything its constructor requires (which I have elided). We can't
compile without resolving these dependencies, even if we never actually
use an object of this type at runtime!

Testing can be a problem. If MyServiceImpl is a heavyweight object,
we will need to make sure that an appropriate TEST DOUBLE1 or MOCK
OBJECT gets assigned to the service field before this method is called during
unit testing. Because we have construction logic mixed in with normal
runtime processing, we should test all execution paths (for example, the
null test and its block). Having both of these responsibilities means that
the method is doing more than one thing, so we are breaking the Single
Responsibility Principle in a small way.

1. [Mezzaros07].

Perhaps worst of all, we do not know whether MyServiceImpl is the
right object in all cases. I implied as much in the comment. Why does the
class with this method have to know the global context? Can we ever really
know the right object to use here? Is it even possible for one type to be right
for all possible contexts?

One occurrence of LAZY-INITIALIZATION isn't a serious problem, of course.
However, there are normally many instances of little setup idioms like this
in applications. Hence, the global setup strategy (if there is one) is scattered
across the application, with little modularity and often significant
duplication.

If we are diligent about building well-formed and robust systems, we
should never let little, convenient idioms lead to modularity breakdown.
The startup process of object construction and wiring is no exception. We
should modularize this process separately from the normal runtime logic
and we should make sure that we have a global, consistent strategy for
resolving our major dependencies.

Separation of Main

One way to separate construction from use is simply to move all aspects of
construction to main, or modules called by main, and to design the rest of
the system assuming that all objects have been constructed and wired up
appropriately. (See Figure 11-1.)
The flow of control is easy to follow. The main function builds the objects
necessary for the system, then passes them to the application, which simply
uses them. Notice the direction of the dependency arrows crossing the
barrier between main and the application. They all go one direction,
pointing away from main. This means that the application has no
knowledge of main or of the construction process. It simply expects that
everything has been built properly.
Factories
Sometimes, of course, we need to make the application responsible for
when an object gets created. For example, in an order processing system the
application must create the
Figure 11-1 Separating construction in main()

LineItem instances to add to an Order. In this case we can use the
ABSTRACT FACTORY2 pattern to give the application control of when to build
the LineItems, but keep the details of that construction separate from the
application code. (See Figure 11-2.)

2. [GOF].

Figure 11-2 Separation construction with factory
Again notice that all the dependencies point from main toward the
OrderProcessing application. This means that the application is
decoupled from the details of how to build a LineItem. That capability is
held in the LineItemFactoryImplementation, which is on the
main side of the line. And yet the application is in complete control of
when the LineItem instances get built and can even provide applicationspecific constructor arguments.

Dependency Injection

A powerful mechanism for separating construction from use is Dependency
Injection (DI), the application of Inversion of Control (IoC) to dependency
management.3 Inversion of Control moves secondary responsibilities from
an object to other objects that are dedicated to the purpose, thereby
supporting the Single Responsibility Principle. In the context of dependency
management, an object should not take responsibility for instantiating
dependencies itself. Instead, it should pass this responsibility to another
"authoritative" mechanism, thereby inverting the control. Because setup is a
global concern, this authoritative mechanism will usually be either the
"main" routine or a special-purpose container.

3. See, for example, [Fowler].

JNDI lookups are a "partial" implementation of DI, where an object asks a
directory server to provide a "service" matching a particular name.
Click here to view code image

          MyService myService = (MyService)
     (jndiContext.lookup("NameOfMyService"));

The invoking object doesn't control what kind of object is actually returned
(as long it implements the appropriate interface, of course), but the invoking
object still actively resolves the dependency.

True Dependency Injection goes one step further. The class takes no direct
steps to resolve its dependencies; it is completely passive. Instead, it
provides setter methods or constructor arguments (or both) that are used to
inject the dependencies. During the construction process, the DI container
instantiates the required objects (usually on demand) and uses the
constructor arguments or setter methods provided to wire together the
dependencies. Which dependent objects are actually used is specified
through a configuration file or programmatically in a special-purpose
construction module.

The Spring Framework provides the best known DI container for Java.4
You define which objects to wire together in an XML configuration file,
then you ask for particular objects by name in Java code. We will look at an
example shortly.

4. See [Spring]. There is also a Spring.NET framework.

But what about the virtues of LAZY-INITIALIZATION? This idiom is still
sometimes useful with DI. First, most DI containers won't construct an
object until needed. Second, many of these containers provide mechanisms
for invoking factories or for constructing proxies, which could be used for
LAZY-EVALUATION and similar optimizations.5

5. Don't forget that lazy instantiation/evaluation is just an optimization and
perhaps premature!
Scaling Up

Cities grow from towns, which grow from settlements. At first the roads are
narrow and practically nonexistent, then they are paved, then widened over
time. Small buildings and empty plots are filled with larger buildings, some
of which will eventually be replaced with skyscrapers.

At first there are no services like power, water, sewage, and the Internet
(gasp!). These services are also added as the population and building
densities increase.

This growth is not without pain. How many times have you driven, bumper
to bumper through a road "improvement" project and asked yourself, "Why
didn't they build it wide enough the first time!?"

But it couldn't have happened any other way. Who can justify the expense
of a six-lane highway through the middle of a small town that anticipates
growth? Who would want such a road through their town?

It is a myth that we can get systems "right the first time." Instead, we
should implement only today's stories, then refactor and expand the system
to implement new stories tomorrow. This is the essence of iterative and
incremental agility. Test-driven development, refactoring, and the clean
code they produce make this work at the code level.

But what about at the system level? Doesn't the system architecture require
preplanning? Certainly, it can't grow incrementally from simple to
complex, can it?

         Software systems are unique compared to physical systems. Their
         architectures can grow incrementally, ifwe maintain the proper
         separation of concerns.

The ephemeral nature of software systems makes this possible, as we will
see. Let us first consider a counterexample of an architecture that doesn't
separate concerns adequately.

The original EJB1 and EJB2 architectures did not separate concerns
appropriately and thereby imposed unnecessary barriers to organic growth.
Consider an Entity Bean for a persistent Bank class. An entity bean is an
in-memory representation of relational data, in other words, a table row.
First, you had to define a local (in process) or remote (separate JVM)
interface, which clients would use. Listing 11-1 shows a possible local
interface:

Listing 11-1 An EJB2 local interface for a Bank EJB

          package com.example.banking;
          import java.util.Collections;
          import javax.ejb.*;

          public interface BankLocal extends java.ejb.EJBLocalObject {
              String getStreetAddr1() throws EJBException;
              String getStreetAddr2() throws EJBException;
              String getCity() throws EJBException;
              String getState() throws EJBException;
              String getZipCode() throws EJBException;
              void setStreetAddr1(String street1) throws EJBException;
              void setStreetAddr2(String street2) throws EJBException;
              void setCity(String city) throws EJBException;
              void setState(String state) throws EJBException;
              void setZipCode(String zip) throws EJBException;
              Collection getAccounts() throws EJBException;
              void setAccounts(Collection accounts) throws EJBException;
              void addAccount(AccountDTO accountDTO) throws EJBException;

          }

I have shown several attributes for the Bank's address and a collection of
accounts that the bank owns, each of which would have its data handled by
a separate Account EJB. Listing 11-2 shows the corresponding
implementation class for the Bank bean.

Implementation

          import java.util.Collections;

          public abstract class Bank implements javax.ejb.EntityBean {
              // Business logic...
              public abstract String getStreetAddr1();
              public abstract String getStreetAddr2();
              public abstract String getCity();
              public abstract String getState();

              public abstract void setStreetAddr1(String street1);
              public abstract void setStreetAddr2(String street2);

                  InitialContext context = new InitialContext();
                  AccountHomeLocal accountHome =
     context.lookup("AccountHomeLocal");
                  AccountLocal account = accountHome.create(accountDTO);
                  Collection accounts = getAccounts();
                  accounts.add(account);
              }
              // EJB container logic
              public abstract void setId(Integer id);
              public abstract Integer getId();
              public Integer ejbCreate(Integer id) { ... }
              public void ejbPostCreate(Integer id) { ... }
              // The rest had to be implemented but were usually empty:
              public void setEntityContext(EntityContext ctx) {}
              public void unsetEntityContext() {}
              public void ejbActivate() {}
              public void ejbPassivate() {}
              public void ejbLoad() {}
              public void ejbStore() {}
              public void ejbRemove() {}
          }

I haven't shown the corresponding LocalHome interface, essentially a
factory used to create objects, nor any of the possible Bank finder (query)
methods you might add.

Finally, you had to write one or more XML deployment descriptors that
specify the object-relational mapping details to a persistence store, the
desired transactional behavior, security constraints, and so on.

The business logic is tightly coupled to the EJB2 application "container."
You must subclass container types and you must provide many lifecycle
methods that are required by the container.

Because of this coupling to the heavyweight container, isolated unit testing
is difficult. It is necessary to mock out the container, which is hard, or waste
a lot of time deploying EJBs and tests to a real server. Reuse outside of the
EJB2 architecture is effectively impossible, due to the tight coupling.
Finally, even object-oriented programming is undermined. One bean cannot
inherit from another bean. Notice the logic for adding a new account. It is
common in EJB2 beans to define "data transfer objects" (DTOs) that are
essentially "structs" with no behavior. This usually leads to redundant types
holding essentially the same data, and it requires boilerplate code to copy
data from one object to another.

Cross-Cutting Concerns

The EJB2 architecture comes close to true separation of concerns in some
areas. For example, the desired transactional, security, and some of the
persistence behaviors are declared in the deployment descriptors,
independently of the source code.

Note that concerns like persistence tend to cut across the natural object
boundaries of a domain. You want to persist all your objects using generally
the same strategy, for example, using a particular DBMS6 versus flat files,
following certain naming conventions for tables and columns, using
consistent transactional semantics, and so on.

6. Database management system.

In principle, you can reason about your persistence strategy in a modular,
encapsulated way. Yet, in practice, you have to spread essentially the same
code that implements the persistence strategy across many objects. We use
the term cross-cutting concerns for concerns like these. Again, the
persistence framework might be modular and our domain logic, in isolation,
might be modular. The problem is the fine-grained intersection of these
domains.

In fact, the way the EJB architecture handled persistence, security, and
transactions, "anticipated" aspect-oriented programming (AOP),7 which is
a general-purpose approach to restoring modularity for cross-cutting
concerns.

7. See [AOSD] for general information on aspects and [AspectJ]] and [Colyer] for AspectJ-specific
information.

In AOP, modular constructs called aspects specify which points in the
system should have their behavior modified in some consistent way to
support a particular concern. This specification is done using a succinct
declarative or programmatic mechanism.
Using persistence as an example, you would declare which objects and
attributes (or patterns thereof) should be persisted and then delegate the
persistence tasks to your persistence framework. The behavior
modifications are made noninvasively8 to the target code by the AOP
framework. Let us look at three aspects or aspect-like mechanisms in Java.

8. Meaning no manual editing of the target source code is required.
Java Proxies

Java proxies are suitable for simple situations, such as wrapping method
calls in individual objects or classes. However, the dynamic proxies
provided in the JDK only work with interfaces. To proxy classes, you have
to use a byte-code manipulation library, such as CGLIB, ASM, or
Javassist.9

9. See [CGLIB], [ASM], and [Javassist].

Listing 11-3 shows the skeleton for a JDK proxy to provide persistence
support for our Bank application, covering only the methods for getting
and setting the list of accounts.

     args)

                     throws Throwable {

                  if (methodName.equals("getAccounts")) {

              new Class[] { Bank.class },
              new BankProxyHandler(new BankImpl()));

We defined an interface Bank, which will be wrapped by the proxy, and a
Plain-Old Java Object (POJO), BankImpl, that implements the business
logic. (We will revisit POJOs shortly.)

The Proxy API requires an InvocationHandler object that it calls to
implement any Bank method calls made to the proxy. Our
BankProxyHandler uses the Java reflection API to map the generic
method invocations to the corresponding methods in BankImpl, and so
on.

There is a lot of code here and it is relatively complicated, even for this
simple case.10 Using one of the byte-manipulation libraries is similarly
challenging. This code "volume"

10. For more detailed examples of the Proxy API and examples of its use, see, for example, [Goetz].

and complexity are two of the drawbacks of proxies. They make it hard to
create clean code! Also, proxies don't provide a mechanism for specifying
system-wide execution "points" of interest, which is needed for a true AOP
solution.11

11. AOP is sometimes confused with techniques used to implement it, such as method interception
and "wrapping" through proxies. The real value of an AOP system is the ability to specify systemic
behaviors in a concise and modular way.
Pure Java AOP Frameworks

Fortunately, most of the proxy boilerplate can be handled automatically by
tools. Proxies are used internally in several Java frameworks, for example,
Spring AOP and JBoss AOP, to implement aspects in pure Java.12 In
Spring, you write your business logic as Plain-Old Java Objects. POJOs are
purely focused on their domain. They have no dependencies on enterprise
frameworks (or any other domains). Hence, they are conceptually simpler
and easier to test drive. The relative simplicity makes it easier to ensure that
you are implementing the corresponding user stories correctly and to
maintain and evolve the code for future stories.

12. See [Spring] and [JBoss]. "Pure Java" means without the use of AspectJ.

You incorporate the required application infrastructure, including crosscutting concerns like persistence, transactions, security, caching, failover,
and so on, using declarative configuration files or APIs. In many cases, you
are actually specifying Spring or JBoss library aspects, where the
framework handles the mechanics of using Java proxies or byte-code
libraries transparently to the user. These declarations drive the dependency
injection (DI) container, which instantiates the major objects and wires
them together on demand.

Listing 11-4 shows a typical fragment of a Spring V2.5 configuration file,
app.xml13:

          <beans>
              ...
              <bean id="appDataSource"
              class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource"
              destroy-method="close"
              p:driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
              p:url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb"
              p:username="me"/>

              <bean id="bankDataAccessObject"
              class="com.example.banking.persistence.BankDataAccessObject
     "
              p:dataSource-ref="appDataSource"/>
              <bean id="bank"
              class="com.example.banking.model.Bank"
              p:dataAccessObject-ref="bankDataAccessObject"/>
              ...

          </beans>

Each "bean" is like one part of a nested "Russian doll," with a domain
object for a Bank proxied (wrapped) by a data accessor object (DAO),
which is itself proxied by a JDBC driver data source. (See Figure 11-3.)

Figure 11-3 The "Russian doll" of decorators

The client believes it is invoking getAccounts() on a Bank object, but
it is actually talking to the outermost of a set of nested DECORATOR14 objects
that extend the basic behavior of the Bank POJO. We could add other
decorators for transactions, caching, and so forth.

14. [GOF].

In the application, a few lines are needed to ask the DI container for the toplevel objects in the system, as specified in the XML file.

Click here to view code image
          XmlBeanFactory bf =
              new XmlBeanFactory(new ClassPathResource("app.xml",

     getClass()));
          Bank bank = (Bank) bf.getBean("bank");

Because so few lines of Spring-specific Java code are required, the
application is almost completely decoupled from Spring, eliminating all the
tight-coupling problems of systems like EJB2.
Although XML can be verbose and hard to read,15 the "policy" specified in
these configuration files is simpler than the complicated proxy and aspect
logic that is hidden from view and created automatically. This type of
architecture is so compelling that frameworks like Spring led to a complete
overhaul of the EJB standard for version 3. EJB3

15. The example can be simplified using mechanisms that exploit convention over configuration and
Java 5 annotations to reduce the amount of explicit "wiring" logic required.

largely follows the Spring model of declaratively supporting cross-cutting
concerns using XML configuration files and/or Java 5 annotations.

Listing 11-5 shows our Bank object rewritten in EJB316.

          public class Bank implements java.io.Serializable {

                @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
                private int id;

                @Embeddable // An object "inlined" in Bank's DB row
                public class Address {

                     protected String streetAddr1;

                private Collection<Account> accounts = new
     ArrayList<Account>();

                public int getId() {
                     return id;

                }

                public void setId(int id) {
                     this.id = id;

                }

                public void addAccount(Account account) {
                     account.setBank(this);
                     accounts.add(account);

                }

                public Collection<Account> getAccounts() {
                     return accounts;

                }
                public void setAccounts(Collection<Account> accounts) {

                     this.accounts = accounts;
                }
          }

This code is much cleaner than the original EJB2 code. Some of the entity
details are still here, contained in the annotations. However, because none
of that information is outside of the annotations, the code is clean, clear, and
hence easy to test drive, maintain, and so on.

Some or all of the persistence information in the annotations can be moved
to XML deployment descriptors, if desired, leaving a truly pure POJO. If
the persistence mapping details won't change frequently, many teams may
choose to keep the annotations, but with far fewer harmful drawbacks
compared to the EJB2 invasiveness.
AspectJ Aspects

Finally, the most full-featured tool for separating concerns through aspects
is the AspectJ language,17 an extension of Java that provides "first-class"
support for aspects as modularity constructs. The pure Java approaches
provided by Spring AOP and JBoss AOP are sufficient for 80-90 percent of
the cases where aspects are most useful. However, AspectJ provides a very
rich and powerful tool set for separating concerns. The drawback of
AspectJ is the need to adopt several new tools and to learn new language
constructs and usage idioms.

17. See [AspectJ] and [Colyer].

The adoption issues have been partially mitigated by a recently introduced
"annotation form" of AspectJ, where Java 5 annotations are used to define
aspects using pure Java code. Also, the Spring Framework has a number of
features that make incorporation of annotation-based aspects much easier
for a team with limited AspectJ experience.

A full discussion of AspectJ is beyond the scope of this book. See
[AspectJ], [Colyer], and [Spring] for more information.
Test Drive the System Architecture

The power of separating concerns through aspect-like approaches can't be
overstated. If you can write your application's domain logic using POJOs,
decoupled from any architecture concerns at the code level, then it is
possible to truly test drive your architecture. You can evolve it from simple
to sophisticated, as needed, by adopting new technologies on demand. It is
not necessary to do a Big Design Up Front18 (BDUF). In fact, BDUF is
even harmful because it inhibits adapting to change, due to the
psychological resistance to discarding prior effort and because of the way
architecture choices influence subsequent thinking about the design.

18. Not to be confused with the good practice of up-front design, BDUF is the practice of designing
everything up front before implementing anything at all.

Building architects have to do BDUF because it is not feasible to make
radical architectural changes to a large physical structure once construction
is well underway.19 Although software has its own physics,20 it is
economically feasible to make radical change, if the structure of the
software separates its concerns effectively.

19. There is still a significant amount of iterative exploration and discussion of details, even after
construction starts.

20. The term software physics was first used by [Kolence].

This means we can start a software project with a "naively simple" but
nicely decoupled architecture, delivering working user stories quickly, then
adding more infrastructure as we scale up. Some of the world's largest Web
sites have achieved very high availability and performance, using
sophisticated data caching, security, virtualization, and so forth, all done
efficiently and flexibly because the minimally coupled designs are
appropriately simple at each level of abstraction and scope.

Of course, this does not mean that we go into a project "rudderless." We
have some expectations of the general scope, goals, and schedule for the
project, as well as the general structure of the resulting system. However,
we must maintain the ability to change course in response to evolving
circumstances.

The early EJB architecture is but one of many well-known APIs that are
over-engineered and that compromise separation of concerns. Even welldesigned APIs can be overkill when they aren't really needed. A good API
should largely disappear from view most of the time, so the team expends
the majority of its creative efforts focused on the user stories being
implemented. If not, then the architectural constraints will inhibit the
efficient delivery of optimal value to the customer.

To recap this long discussion,

         An optimal system architecture consists of modularized domains of
         concern, each of which is implemented with Plain Old Java (or
         other) Objects. The different domains are integrated together with
         minimally invasive Aspects or Aspect-like tools. This architecture
         can be test-driven, just like the code.
Optimize Decision Making

Modularity and separation of concerns make decentralized management and
decision making possible. In a sufficiently large system, whether it is a city
or a software project, no one person can make all the decisions.

We all know it is best to give responsibilities to the most qualified persons.
We often forget that it is also best to postpone decisions until the last
possible moment. This isn't lazy or irresponsible; it lets us make informed
choices with the best possible information. A premature decision is a
decision made with suboptimal knowledge. We will have that much less
customer feedback, mental reflection on the project, and experience with
our implementation choices if we decide too soon.

         The agility provided by a POJO system with modularized concerns
         allows us to make optimal, just-in-time decisions, based on the most
         recent knowledge. The complexity of these decisions is also reduced.
Use Standards Wisely, When They Add Demonstrable Value

Building construction is a marvel to watch because of the pace at which
new buildings are built (even in the dead of winter) and because of the
extraordinary designs that are possible with today's technology.
Construction is a mature industry with highly optimized parts, methods, and
standards that have evolved under pressure for centuries.

Many teams used the EJB2 architecture because it was a standard, even
when lighter-weight and more straightforward designs would have been
sufficient. I have seen teams become obsessed with various strongly hyped
standards and lose focus on implementing value for their customers.

         Standards make it easier to reuse ideas and components, recruit
         people with relevant experience, encapsulate good ideas, and wire
         components together. However, the process of creating standards
         can sometimes take too long for industry to wait, and some
         standards lose touch with the real needs of the adopters they are
         intended to serve.
Systems Need Domain-Specific Languages

Building construction, like most domains, has developed a rich language
with a vocabulary, idioms, and patterns21 that convey essential information
clearly and concisely. In software, there has been renewed interest recently
in creating Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs),22 which are separate, small
scripting languages or APIs in standard languages that permit code to be
written so that it reads like a structured form of prose that a domain expert
might write.

21. The work of [Alexander] has been particularly influential on the software community.
22. See, for example, [DSL]. [JMock] is a good example of a Java API that creates a DSL.

A good DSL minimizes the "communication gap" between a domain
concept and the code that implements it, just as agile practices optimize the
communications within a team and with the project's stakeholders. If you
are implementing domain logic in the same language that a domain expert
uses, there is less risk that you will incorrectly translate the domain into the
implementation.

DSLs, when used effectively, raise the abstraction level above code idioms
and design patterns. They allow the developer to reveal the intent of the
code at the appropriate level of abstraction.

         Domain-Specific Languages allow all levels of abstraction and all
         domains in the application to be expressed as POJOs, from high-
         level policy to low-level details.
Conclusion

Systems must be clean too. An invasive architecture overwhelms the
domain logic and impacts agility. When the domain logic is obscured,
quality suffers because bugs find it easier to hide and stories become harder
to implement. If agility is compromised, productivity suffers and the
benefits of TDD are lost.

At all levels of abstraction, the intent should be clear. This will only happen
if you write POJOs and you use aspect-like mechanisms to incorporate
other implementation concerns noninvasively.

Whether you are designing systems or individual modules, never forget to
use the simplest thing that can possibly work.

Emergence

           by Jeff Langr
Getting Clean via Emergent Design

What if there were four simple rules that you could follow that would help
you create good designs as you worked? What if by following these rules
you gained insights into the structure and design of your code, making it
easier to apply principles such as SRP and DIP? What if these four rules
facilitated the emergence of good designs?
Many of us feel that Kent Beck's four rules of Simple Design1 are of
significant help in creating well-designed software.

1. [XPE].

According to Kent, a design is "simple" if it follows these rules:

 � Runs all the tests

 � Contains no duplication

 � Expresses the intent of the programmer

 � Minimizes the number of classes and methods

The rules are given in order of importance.
Simple Design Rule 1: Runs All the Tests

First and foremost, a design must produce a system that acts as intended. A
system might have a perfect design on paper, but if there is no simple way
to verify that the system actually works as intended, then all the paper effort
is questionable.

A system that is comprehensively tested and passes all of its tests all of the
time is a testable system. That's an obvious statement, but an important one.
Systems that aren't testable aren't verifiable. Arguably, a system that cannot
be verified should never be deployed.

Fortunately, making our systems testable pushes us toward a design where
our classes are small and single purpose. It's just easier to test classes that
conform to the SRP. The more tests we write, the more we'll continue to
push toward things that are simpler to test. So making sure our system is
fully testable helps us create better designs.

Tight coupling makes it difficult to write tests. So, similarly, the more tests
we write, the more we use principles like DIP and tools like dependency
injection, interfaces, and abstraction to minimize coupling. Our designs
improve even more.

Remarkably, following a simple and obvious rule that says we need to have
tests and run them continuously impacts our system's adherence to the
primary OO goals of low coupling and high cohesion. Writing tests leads to
better designs.
Simple Design Rules 2-4: Refactoring

Once we have tests, we are empowered to keep our code and classes clean.
We do this by incrementally refactoring the code. For each few lines of
code we add, we pause and reflect on the new design. Did we just degrade
it? If so, we clean it up and run our tests to demonstrate that we haven't
broken anything. The fact that we have these tests eliminates the fear that
cleaning up the code will break it!

During this refactoring step, we can apply anything from the entire body of
knowledge about good software design. We can increase cohesion, decrease
coupling, separate concerns, modularize system concerns, shrink our
functions and classes, choose better names, and so on. This is also where
we apply the final three rules of simple design: Eliminate duplication,
ensure expressiveness, and minimize the number of classes and methods.
No Duplication

Duplication is the primary enemy of a well-designed system. It represents
additional work, additional risk, and additional unnecessary complexity.
Duplication manifests itself in many forms. Lines of code that look exactly
alike are, of course, duplication. Lines of code that are similar can often be
massaged to look even more alike so that they can be more easily
refactored. And duplication can exist in other forms such as duplication of
implementation. For example, we might have two methods in a collection
class:

          int size() {}
          boolean isEmpty() {}

We could have separate implementations for each method. The isEmpty
method could track a boolean, while size could track a counter. Or, we
can eliminate this duplication by tying isEmpty to the definition of
size:

          boolean isEmpty() {
                return 0 == size();

          }

Creating a clean system requires the will to eliminate duplication, even in
just a few lines of code. For example, consider the following code:

Click here to view code image

          public void scaleToOneDimension(
                   float desiredDimension, float imageDimension) {

              if (Math.abs(desiredDimension - imageDimension) <
     errorThreshold)

                   return;
              float scalingFactor = desiredDimension / imageDimension;
              scalingFactor = (float)(Math.floor(scalingFactor * 100) *
     0.01f);

              RenderedOp newImage = ImageUtilities.getScaledImage(
                   image, scalingFactor, scalingFactor);

              image.dispose();
              System.gc();
              image = newImage;
          }
          public synchronized void rotate(int degrees) {

                RenderedOp newImage = ImageUtilities.getRotatedImage(
                     image, degrees);
                image.dispose();
                System.gc();
                image = newImage;
          }

To keep this system clean, we should eliminate the small amount of
duplication between the scaleToOneDimension and rotate
methods:

Click here to view code image

          public void scaleToOneDimension(
                   float desiredDimension, float imageDimension) {

              if (Math.abs(desiredDimension - imageDimension) <
     errorThreshold)

                   return;
              float scalingFactor = desiredDimension / imageDimension;
              scalingFactor = (float)(Math.floor(scalingFactor * 100) *
     0.01f);

                replaceImage(ImageUtilities.getScaledImage(
                     image, scalingFactor, scalingFactor));

          }

          public synchronized void rotate(int degrees) {
                replaceImage(ImageUtilities.getRotatedImage(image,

     degrees));
          }

          privatex void replaceImage(RenderedOp newImage) {
                image.dispose();
                System.gc();
                image = newImage;

          }

As we extract commonality at this very tiny level, we start to recognize
violations of SRP. So we might move a newly extracted method to another
class. That elevates its visibility. Someone else on the team may recognize
the opportunity to further abstract the new method and reuse it in a different
context. This "reuse in the small" can cause system complexity to shrink
dramatically. Understanding how to achieve reuse in the small is essential
to achieving reuse in the large.

The TEMPLATE METHOD2 pattern is a common technique for removing
higher-level duplication. For example:

Click here to view code image
     public class VacationPolicy {
          public void accrueUSDivisionVacation() {
                // code to calculate vacation based on hours worked to

date
                // ...
                // code to ensure vacation meets US minimums
                // ...
                // code to apply vacation to payroll record
                // ...

          }

date    public void accrueEUDivisionVacation() {
     }       // code to calculate vacation based on hours worked to

             // ...
             // code to ensure vacation meets EU minimums
             // ...
             // code to apply vaction to payroll record
             // ...
        }

The code across accrueUSDivisionVacation and
accrueEuropeanDivisionVacation is largely the same, with the
exception of calculating legal minimums. That bit of the algorithm changes
based on the employee type.

We can eliminate the obvious duplication by applying the TEMPLATE
METHOD pattern.

Click here to view code image

abstract public class VacationPolicy {
     public void accrueVacation() {
          calculateBaseVacationHours();
          alterForLegalMinimums();
          applyToPayroll();
     }

     private void calculateBaseVacationHours() { /* ... */ };
     abstract protected void alterForLegalMinimums();
     private void applyToPayroll() { /* ... */ };
}

public class       USVacationPolicy extends VacationPolicy {
     @Override     protected void alterForLegalMinimums() {
            // US  specific logic
     }

}
public class       EUVacationPolicy extends VacationPolicy {
     @Override     protected void alterForLegalMinimums() {
            // EU  specific logic
     }

}

The subclasses fill in the "hole" in the accrueVacation algorithm,
supplying the only bits of information that are not duplicated.
Expressive

Most of us have had the experience of working on convoluted code. Many
of us have produced some convoluted code ourselves. It's easy to write
code that we understand, because at the time we write it we're deep in an
understanding of the problem we're trying to solve. Other maintainers of
the code aren't going to have so deep an understanding.

The majority of the cost of a software project is in long-term maintenance.
In order to minimize the potential for defects as we introduce change, it's
critical for us to be able to understand what a system does. As systems
become more complex, they take more and more time for a developer to
understand, and there is an ever greater opportunity for a misunderstanding.
Therefore, code should clearly express the intent of its author. The clearer
the author can make the code, the less time others will have to spend
understanding it. This will reduce defects and shrink the cost of
maintenance.

You can express yourself by choosing good names. We want to be able to
hear a class or function name and not be surprised when we discover its
responsibilities.

You can also express yourself by keeping your functions and classes small.
Small classes and functions are usually easy to name, easy to write, and
easy to understand.

You can also express yourself by using standard nomenclature. Design
patterns, for example, are largely about communication and expressiveness.
By using the standard pattern names, such as COMMAND or VISITOR, in the
names of the classes that implement those patterns, you can succinctly
describe your design to other developers.

Well-written unit tests are also expressive. A primary goal of tests is to act
as documentation by example. Someone reading our tests should be able to
get a quick understanding of what a class is all about.

But the most important way to be expressive is to try. All too often we get
our code working and then move on to the next problem without giving
sufficient thought to making that code easy for the next person to read.
Remember, the most likely next person to read the code will be you.
So take a little pride in your workmanship. Spend a little time with each of
your functions and classes. Choose better names, split large functions into
smaller functions, and generally just take care of what you've created. Care
is a precious resource.
Minimal Classes and Methods

Even concepts as fundamental as elimination of duplication, code
expressiveness, and the SRP can be taken too far. In an effort to make our
classes and methods small, we might create too many tiny classes and
methods. So this rule suggests that we also keep our function and class
counts low.

High class and method counts are sometimes the result of pointless
dogmatism. Consider, for example, a coding standard that insists on
creating an interface for each and every class. Or consider developers who
insist that fields and behavior must always be separated into data classes
and behavior classes. Such dogma should be resisted and a more pragmatic
approach adopted.

Our goal is to keep our overall system small while we are also keeping our
functions and classes small. Remember, however, that this rule is the lowest
priority of the four rules of Simple Design. So, although it's important to
keep class and function count low, it's more important to have tests,
eliminate duplication, and express yourself.
Conclusion

Is there a set of simple practices that can replace experience? Clearly not.
On the other hand, the practices described in this chapter and in this book
are a crystallized form of the many decades of experience enjoyed by the
authors. Following the practice of simple design can and does encourage
and enable developers to adhere to good principles and patterns that
otherwise take years to learn.

Concurrency

             by Brett L. Schuchert

         "Objects are abstractions of processing. Threads are abstractions of
         schedule."

                                                     --James O. Coplien1

1. Private correspondence.

Writing clean concurrent programs is hard--very hard. It is much easier to
write code that executes in a single thread. It is also easy to write
multithreaded code that looks fine on the surface but is broken at a deeper
level. Such code works fine until the system is placed under stress.
In this chapter we discuss the need for concurrent programming, and the
difficulties it presents. We then present several recommendations for
dealing with those difficulties, and writing clean concurrent code. Finally,
we conclude with issues related to testing concurrent code.

Clean Concurrency is a complex topic, worthy of a book by itself. Our
strategy in this book is to present an overview here and provide a more
detailed tutorial in "Concurrency II" on page 317. If you are just curious
about concurrency, then this chapter will suffice for you now. If you have a
need to understand concurrency at a deeper level, then you should read
through the tutorial as well.
Why Concurrency?

Concurrency is a decoupling strategy. It helps us decouple what gets done
from when it gets done. In single-threaded applications what and when are
so strongly coupled that the state of the entire application can often be
determined by looking at the stack backtrace. A programmer who debugs
such a system can set a breakpoint, or a sequence of breakpoints, and know
the state of the system by which breakpoints are hit.

Decoupling what from when can dramatically improve both the throughput
and structures of an application. From a structural point of view the
application looks like many little collaborating computers rather than one
big main loop. This can make the system easier to understand and offers
some powerful ways to separate concerns.

Consider, for example, the standard "Servlet" model of Web applications.
These systems run under the umbrella of a Web or EJB container that
partially manages concurrency for you. The servlets are executed
asynchronously whenever Web requests come in. The servlet programmer
does not have to manage all the incoming requests. In principle, each
servlet execution lives in its own little world and is decoupled from all the
other servlet executions.

Of course if it were that easy, this chapter wouldn't be necessary. In fact,
the decoupling provided by Web containers is far less than perfect. Servlet
programmers have to be very aware, and very careful, to make sure their
concurrent programs are correct. Still, the structural benefits of the servlet
model are significant.

But structure is not the only motive for adopting concurrency. Some
systems have response time and throughput constraints that require handcoded concurrent solutions. For example, consider a single-threaded
information aggregator that acquires information from many different Web
sites and merges that information into a daily summary. Because this system
is single threaded, it hits each Web site in turn, always finishing one before
starting the next. The daily run needs to execute in less than 24 hours.
However, as more and more Web sites are added, the time grows until it
takes more than 24 hours to gather all the data. The single-thread involves a
lot of waiting at Web sockets for I/O to complete. We could improve the
performance by using a multithreaded algorithm that hits more than one
Web site at a time.

Or consider a system that handles one user at a time and requires only one
second of time per user. This system is fairly responsive for a few users, but
as the number of users increases, the system's response time increases. No
user wants to get in line behind 150 others! We could improve the response
time of this system by handling many users concurrently.

Or consider a system that interprets large data sets but can only give a
complete solution after processing all of them. Perhaps each data set could
be processed on a different computer, so that many data sets are being
processed in parallel.

Myths and Misconceptions

And so there are compelling reasons to adopt concurrency. However, as we
said before, concurrency is hard. If you aren't very careful, you can create
some very nasty situations. Consider these common myths and
misconceptions:

   � Concurrency always improves performance.
      Concurrency can sometimes improve performance, but only when
      there is a lot of wait time that can be shared between multiple threads
      or multiple processors. Neither situation is trivial.

   � Design does not change when writing concurrent programs.
      In fact, the design of a concurrent algorithm can be remarkably
      different from the design of a single-threaded system. The decoupling
      of what from when usually has a huge effect on the structure of the
      system.

   � Understanding concurrency issues is not important when working with
      a container such as a Web or EJB container.
      In fact, you'd better know just what your container is doing and how to
      guard against the issues of concurrent update and deadlock described
      later in this chapter.

      Here are a few more balanced sound bites regarding writing
           concurrent software:
   � Concurrency incurs some overhead, both in performance as well as
     writing additional code.

   � Correct concurrency is complex, even for simple problems.

   � Concurrency bugs aren't usually repeatable, so they are often ignored
     as one-offs2 instead of the true defects they are.

2. Cosmic-rays, glitches, and so on.

   � Concurrency often requires a fundamental change in design strategy.
Challenges

What makes concurrent programming so difficult? Consider the following
trivial class:

Click here to view code image

          public class X {
                private int lastIdUsed;

                public int getNextId() {
                         return ++lastIdUsed;

                  }
          }

Let's say we create an instance of X, set the lastIdUsed field to 42, and
then share the instance between two threads. Now suppose that both of
those threads call the method getNextId(); there are three possible
outcomes:

   � Thread one gets the value 43, thread two gets the value 44,
      lastIdUsed is 44.

   � Thread one gets the value 44, thread two gets the value 43,
      lastIdUsed is 44.

   � Thread one gets the value 43, thread two gets the value 43,
      lastIdUsed is 43.

The surprising third result3 occurs when the two threads step on each other.
This happens because there are many possible paths that the two threads
can take through that one line of Java code, and some of those paths
generate incorrect results. How many different paths are there? To really
answer that question, we need to understand what the Just-In-Time
Compiler does with the generated byte-code, and understand what the Java
memory model considers to be atomic.

3. See "Digging Deeper" on page 323.

A quick answer, working with just the generated byte-code, is that there are
12,870 different possible execution paths4 for those two threads executing
within the getNextId method. If the type of lastIdUsed is changed
from int to long, the number of possible paths increases to 2,704,156. Of
course most of those paths generate valid results. The problem is that some
of them don't.

4. See "Possible Paths of Execution" on page 321.
Concurrency Defense Principles

What follows is a series of principles and techniques for defending your
systems from the problems of concurrent code.

Single Responsibility Principle

The SRP5 states that a given method/class/component should have a single
reason to change. Concurrency design is complex enough to be a reason to
change in it's own right and therefore deserves to be separated from the rest
of the code. Unfortunately, it is all too common for concurrency
implementation details to be embedded directly into other production code.
Here are a few things to consider:

5. [PPP]

   � Concurrency-related code has its own life cycle of development,
      change, and tuning.

   � Concurrency-related code has its own challenges, which are different
      from and often more difficult than nonconcurrency-related code.

   � The number of ways in which miswritten concurrency-based code can
      fail makes it challenging enough without the added burden of
      surrounding application code.

Recommendation: Keep your concurrency-related code separate from
other code.6

6. See "Client/Server Example" on page 317.

Corollary: Limit the Scope of Data

As we saw, two threads modifying the same field of a shared object can
interfere with each other, causing unexpected behavior. One solution is to
use the synchronized keyword to protect a critical section in the code
that uses the shared object. It is important to restrict the number of such
critical sections. The more places shared data can get updated, the more
likely:

   � You will forget to protect one or more of those places--effectively
      breaking all code that modifies that shared data.
   � There will be duplication of effort required to make sure everything is
      effectively guarded (violation of DRY7).

7. [PRAG].

   � It will be difficult to determine the source of failures, which are already
      hard enough to find.

Recommendation: Take data encapsulation to heart; severely limit the
access of any data that may be shared.

Corollary: Use Copies of Data

A good way to avoid shared data is to avoid sharing the data in the first
place. In some situations it is possible to copy objects and treat them as
read-only. In other cases it might be possible to copy objects, collect results
from multiple threads in these copies and then merge the results in a single
thread.

If there is an easy way to avoid sharing objects, the resulting code will be
far less likely to cause problems. You might be concerned about the cost of
all the extra object creation. It is worth experimenting to find out if this is in
fact a problem. However, if using copies of objects allows the code to avoid
synchronizing, the savings in avoiding the intrinsic lock will likely make up
for the additional creation and garbage collection overhead.

Corollary: Threads Should Be as Independent as Possible

Consider writing your threaded code such that each thread exists in its own
world, sharing no data with any other thread. Each thread processes one
client request, with all of its required data coming from an unshared source
and stored as local variables. This makes each of those threads behave as if
it were the only thread in the world and there were no synchronization
requirements.

For example, classes that subclass from HttpServlet receive all of their
information as parameters passed in to the doGet and doPost methods.
This makes each Servlet act as if it has its own machine. So long as the
code in the Servlet uses only local variables, there is no chance that the
Servlet will cause synchronization problems. Of course, most
applications using Servlets eventually run into shared resources such as
database connections.

Recommendation: Attempt to partition data into independent subsets than
can be operated on by independent threads, possibly in different processors.
Know Your Library

Java 5 offers many improvements for concurrent development over
previous versions. There are several things to consider when writing
threaded code in Java 5:

   � Use the provided thread-safe collections.
   � Use the executor framework for executing unrelated tasks.
   � Use nonblocking solutions when possible.
   � Several library classes are not thread safe.

Thread-Safe Collections
When Java was young, Doug Lea wrote the seminal book8 Concurrent
Programming in Java. Along with the book he developed several threadsafe collections, which later became part of the JDK in the
java.util.concurrent package. The collections in that package are
safe for multithreaded situations and they perform well. In fact, the
ConcurrentHashMap implementation performs better than HashMap
in nearly all situations. It also allows for simultaneous concurrent reads and
writes, and it has methods supporting common composite operations that
are otherwise not thread safe. If Java 5 is the deployment environment, start
with ConcurrentHashMap.

8. [Lea99].

There are several other kinds of classes added to support advanced
concurrency design. Here are a few examples:

Recommendation: Review the classes available to you. In the case of Java,
become familiar with java.util.concurrent, java.util.concurrent.atomic,
java.util.concurrent.locks.
Know Your Execution Models

There are several different ways to partition behavior in a concurrent
application. To discuss them we need to understand some basic definitions.

Given these definitions, we can now discuss the various execution models
used in concurrent programming.
Producer-Consumer9

9. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer-consumer

One or more producer threads create some work and place it in a buffer or
queue. One or more consumer threads acquire that work from the queue and
complete it. The queue between the producers and consumers is a bound
resource. This means producers must wait for free space in the queue before
writing and consumers must wait until there is something in the queue to
consume. Coordination between the producers and consumers via the queue
involves producers and consumers signaling each other. The producers
write to the queue and signal that the queue is no longer empty. Consumers
read from the queue and signal that the queue is no longer full. Both
potentially wait to be notified when they can continue.
Readers-Writers10

10. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers-writers_problem

When you have a shared resource that primarily serves as a source of
information for readers, but which is occasionally updated by writers,
throughput is an issue. Emphasizing throughput can cause starvation and
the accumulation of stale information. Allowing updates can impact
throughput. Coordinating readers so they do not read something a writer is
updating and vice versa is a tough balancing act. Writers tend to block
many readers for a long period of time, thus causing throughput issues.

The challenge is to balance the needs of both readers and writers to satisfy
correct operation, provide reasonable throughput and avoiding starvation. A
simple strategy makes writers wait until there are no readers before
allowing the writer to perform an update. If there are continuous readers,
however, the writers will be starved. On the other hand, if there are frequent
writers and they are given priority, throughput will suffer. Finding that
balance and avoiding concurrent update issues is what the problem
addresses.

Dining Philosophers11

11. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem

Imagine a number of philosophers sitting around a circular table. A fork is
placed to the left of each philosopher. There is a big bowl of spaghetti in the
center of the table. The philosophers spend their time thinking unless they
get hungry. Once hungry, they pick up the forks on either side of them and
eat. A philosopher cannot eat unless he is holding two forks. If the
philosopher to his right or left is already using one of the forks he needs, he
must wait until that philosopher finishes eating and puts the forks back
down. Once a philosopher eats, he puts both his forks back down on the
table and waits until he is hungry again.

Replace philosophers with threads and forks with resources and this
problem is similar to many enterprise applications in which processes
compete for resources. Unless carefully designed, systems that compete in
this way can experience deadlock, livelock, throughput, and efficiency
degradation.
Most concurrent problems you will likely encounter will be some variation
of these three problems. Study these algorithms and write solutions using
them on your own so that when you come across concurrent problems,
you'll be more prepared to solve the problem.

Recommendation: Learn these basic algorithms and understand their
solutions.
Beware Dependencies Between Synchronized Methods

Dependencies between synchronized methods cause subtle bugs in
concurrent code. The Java language has the notion of synchronized,
which protects an individual method. However, if there is more than one
synchronized method on the same shared class, then your system may be
written incorrectly.12

12. See "Dependencies Between Methods Can Break Concurrent Code" on page 329.

Recommendation: Avoid using more than one method on a shared object.

There will be times when you must use more than one method on a shared
object. When this is the case, there are three ways to make the code correct:

   � Client-Based Locking--Have the client lock the server before calling
      the first method and make sure the lock's extent includes code calling
      the last method.

   � Server-Based Locking--Within the server create a method that locks
      the server, calls all the methods, and then unlocks. Have the client call
      the new method.

   � Adapted Server--create an intermediary that performs the locking.
      This is an example of server-based locking, where the original server
      cannot be changed.
Keep Synchronized Sections Small

The synchronized keyword introduces a lock. All sections of code
guarded by the same lock are guaranteed to have only one thread executing
through them at any given time. Locks are expensive because they create
delays and add overhead. So we don't want to litter our code with
synchronized statements. On the other hand, critical sections13 must be
guarded. So we want to design our code with as few critical sections as
possible.

13. A critical section is any section of code that must be protected from simultaneous use for the
program to be correct.

Some naive programmers try to achieve this by making their critical
sections very large. However, extending synchronization beyond the
minimal critical section increases contention and degrades performance.14

14. See "Increasing Throughput" on page 333.

Recommendation: Keep your synchronized sections as small as possible.
Writing Correct Shut-Down Code Is Hard

Writing a system that is meant to stay live and run forever is different from
writing something that works for awhile and then shuts down gracefully.

Graceful shutdown can be hard to get correct. Common problems involve
deadlock,15 with threads waiting for a signal to continue that never comes.

15. See "Deadlock" on page 335.

For example, imagine a system with a parent thread that spawns several
child threads and then waits for them all to finish before it releases its
resources and shuts down. What if one of the spawned threads is
deadlocked? The parent will wait forever, and the system will never shut
down.

Or consider a similar system that has been instructed to shut down. The
parent tells all the spawned children to abandon their tasks and finish. But
what if two of the children were operating as a producer/consumer pair.
Suppose the producer receives the signal from the parent and quickly shuts
down. The consumer might have been expecting a message from the
producer and be blocked in a state where it cannot receive the shutdown
signal. It could get stuck waiting for the producer and never finish,
preventing the parent from finishing as well.

Situations like this are not at all uncommon. So if you must write
concurrent code that involves shutting down gracefully, expect to spend
much of your time getting the shutdown to happen correctly.

Recommendation: Think about shut-down early and get it working early.
It's going to take longer than you expect. Review existing algorithms
because this is probably harder than you think.
Testing Threaded Code

Proving that code is correct is impractical. Testing does not guarantee
correctness. However, good testing can minimize risk. This is all true in a
single-threaded solution. As soon as there are two or more threads using the
same code and working with shared data, things get substantially more
complex.

Recommendation: Write tests that have the potential to expose problems
and then run them frequently, with different programatic configurations and
system configurations and load. If tests ever fail, track down the failure.
Don't ignore a failure just because the tests pass on a subsequent run.

That is a whole lot to take into consideration. Here are a few more finegrained recommendations:

   � Treat spurious failures as candidate threading issues.

   � Get your nonthreaded code working first.

   � Make your threaded code pluggable.

   � Make your threaded code tunable.

   � Run with more threads than processors.

   � Run on different platforms.

   � Instrument your code to try and force failures.

Treat Spurious Failures as Candidate Threading Issues

Threaded code causes things to fail that "simply cannot fail." Most
developers do not have an intuitive feel for how threading interacts with
other code (authors included). Bugs in threaded code might exhibit their
symptoms once in a thousand, or a million, executions. Attempts to repeat
the systems can be frustratingly. This often leads developers to write off the
failure as a cosmic ray, a hardware glitch, or some other kind of "one-off."
It is best to assume that one-offs do not exist. The longer these "one-offs"
are ignored, the more code is built on top of a potentially faulty approach.

Recommendation: Do not ignore system failures as one-offs.
Get Your Nonthreaded Code Working First

This may seem obvious, but it doesn't hurt to reinforce it. Make sure code
works outside of its use in threads. Generally, this means creating POJOs
that are called by your threads. The POJOs are not thread aware, and can
therefore be tested outside of the threaded environment. The more of your
system you can place in such POJOs, the better.

Recommendation: Do not try to chase down nonthreading bugs and
threading bugs at the same time. Make sure your code works outside of
threads.

Make Your Threaded Code Pluggable

Write the concurrency-supporting code such that it can be run in several
configurations:

   � One thread, several threads, varied as it executes

   � Threaded code interacts with something that can be both real or a test
      double.

   � Execute with test doubles that run quickly, slowly, variable.

   � Configure tests so they can run for a number of iterations.

Recommendation: Make your thread-based code especially pluggable so
that you can run it in various configurations.

Make Your Threaded Code Tunable

Getting the right balance of threads typically requires trial an error. Early
on, find ways to time the performance of your system under different
configurations. Allow the number of threads to be easily tuned. Consider
allowing it to change while the system is running. Consider allowing selftuning based on throughput and system utilization.

Run with More Threads Than Processors

Things happen when the system switches between tasks. To encourage task
swapping, run with more threads than processors or cores. The more
frequently your tasks swap, the more likely you'll encounter code that is
missing a critical section or causes deadlock.
Run on Different Platforms

In the middle of 2007 we developed a course on concurrent programming.
The course development ensued primarily under OS X. The class was
presented using Windows XP running under a VM. Tests written to
demonstrate failure conditions did not fail as frequently in an XP
environment as they did running on OS X.

In all cases the code under test was known to be incorrect. This just
reinforced the fact that different operating systems have different threading
policies, each of which impacts the code's execution. Multithreaded code
behaves differently in different environments.16 You should run your tests
in every potential deployment environment.

16. Did you know that the threading model in Java does not guarantee preemptive threading?
Modern OS's support preemptive threading, so you get that "for free." Even so, it not guaranteed by
the JVM.

Recommendation: Run your threaded code on all target platforms early
and often.

Instrument Your Code to Try and Force Failures

It is normal for flaws in concurrent code to hide. Simple tests often don't
expose them. Indeed, they often hide during normal processing. They might
show up once every few hours, or days, or weeks!

The reason that threading bugs can be infrequent, sporadic, and hard to
repeat, is that only a very few pathways out of the many thousands of
possible pathways through a vulnerable section actually fail. So the
probability that a failing pathway is taken can be star-tlingly low. This
makes detection and debugging very difficult.

How might you increase your chances of catching such rare occurrences?
You can instrument your code and force it to run in different orderings by
adding calls to methods like Object.wait(), Object.sleep(),
Object.yield() and Object.priority().

Each of these methods can affect the order of execution, thereby increasing
the odds of detecting a flaw. It's better when broken code fails as early and
as often as possible.

There are two options for code instrumentation:
   � Hand-coded

   � Automated

Hand-Coded

You can insert calls to wait(), sleep(), yield(), and
priority() in your code by hand. It might be just the thing to do when
you're testing a particularly thorny piece of code.

Here is an example of doing just that:

Click here to view code image

            public synchronized String nextUrlOrNull() {
                   if(hasNext()) {
                           String url = urlGenerator.next();
                           Thread.yield(); // inserted for testing.
                           updateHasNext();
                           return url;
                   }
                   return null;

            }

The inserted call to yield() will change the execution pathways taken by
the code and possibly cause the code to fail where it did not fail before. If
the code does break, it was not because you added a call to yield().17
Rather, your code was broken and this simply made the failure evident.

17. This is not strictly the case. Since the JVM does not guarantee preemptive threading, a particular
algorithm might always work on an OS that does not preempt threads. The reverse is also possible
but for different reasons.

There are many problems with this approach:

   � You have to manually find appropriate places to do this.

   � How do you know where to put the call and what kind of call to use?

   � Leaving such code in a production environment unnecessarily slows
      the code down.

   � It's a shotgun approach. You may or may not find flaws. Indeed, the
      odds aren't with you.

What we need is a way to do this during testing but not in production. We
also need to easily mix up configurations between different runs, which
results in increased chances of finding errors in the aggregate.

Clearly, if we divide our system up into POJOs that know nothing of
threading and classes that control the threading, it will be easier to find
appropriate places to instrument the code. Moreover, we could create many
different test jigs that invoke the POJOs under different regimes of calls to
sleep, yield, and so on.

Automated

You could use tools like an Aspect-Oriented Framework, CGLIB, or ASM
to programmatically instrument your code. For example, you could use a
class with a single method:

Click here to view code image

          public class ThreadJigglePoint {
                  public static void jiggle() {
                  }

          }

You can add calls to this in various places within your code:

Click here to view code image

          public synchronized String nextUrlOrNull() {
                  if(hasNext()) {
                         ThreadJiglePoint.jiggle();
                         String url = urlGenerator.next();
                         ThreadJiglePoint.jiggle();
                         updateHasNext();
                         ThreadJiglePoint.jiggle();
                         return url;
                  }
                  return null;

          }

Now you use a simple aspect that randomly selects among doing nothing,
sleeping, or yielding.

Or imagine that the ThreadJigglePoint class has two
implementations. The first implements jiggle to do nothing and is used
in production. The second generates a random number to choose between
sleeping, yielding, or just falling through. If you run your tests a thousand
times with random jiggling, you may root out some flaws. If the tests pass,
at least you can say you've done due diligence. Though a bit simplistic, this
could be a reasonable option in lieu of a more sophisticated tool.

There is a tool called ConTest,18 developed by IBM that does something
similar, but it does so with quite a bit more sophistication.

18. http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/contest

The point is to jiggle the code so that threads run in different orderings at
different times. The combination of well-written tests and jiggling can
dramatically increase the chance finding errors.

Recommendation: Use jiggling strategies to ferret out errors.
Conclusion

Concurrent code is difficult to get right. Code that is simple to follow can
become nightmarish when multiple threads and shared data get into the
mix. If you are faced with writing concurrent code, you need to write clean
code with rigor or else face subtle and infrequent failures.

First and foremost, follow the Single Responsibility Principle. Break your
system into POJOs that separate thread-aware code from thread-ignorant
code. Make sure when you are testing your thread-aware code, you are only
testing it and nothing else. This suggests that your thread-aware code
should be small and focused.

Know the possible sources of concurrency issues: multiple threads
operating on shared data, or using a common resource pool. Boundary
cases, such as shutting down cleanly or finishing the iteration of a loop, can
be especially thorny.

Learn your library and know the fundamental algorithms. Understand how
some of the features offered by the library support solving problems similar
to the fundamental algorithms.

Learn how to find regions of code that must be locked and lock them. Do
not lock regions of code that do not need to be locked. Avoid calling one
locked section from another. This requires a deep understanding of whether
something is or is not shared. Keep the amount of shared objects and the
scope of the sharing as narrow as possible. Change designs of the objects
with shared data to accommodate clients rather than forcing clients to
manage shared state.

Issues will crop up. The ones that do not crop up early are often written off
as a onetime occurrence. These so-called one-offs typically only happen
under load or at seemingly random times. Therefore, you need to be able to
run your thread-related code in many configurations on many platforms
repeatedly and continuously. Testability, which comes naturally from
following the Three Laws of TDD, implies some level of plug-ability,
which offers the support necessary to run code in a wider range of
configurations.
You will greatly improve your chances of finding erroneous code if you
take the time to instrument your code. You can either do so by hand or
using some kind of automated technology. Invest in this early. You want to
be running your thread-based code as long as possible before you put it into
production.

If you take a clean approach, your chances of getting it right increase
drastically.

Successive Refinement

                  Case Study of a Command-Line Argument Parser

This chapter is a case study in successive refinement. You will see a module
that started well but did not scale. Then you will see how the module was
refactored and cleaned.
Most of us have had to parse command-line arguments from time to time. If
we don't have a convenient utility, then we simply walk the array of strings
that is passed into the main function. There are several good utilities
available from various sources, but none of them do exactly what I want.
So, of course, I decided to write my own. I call it: Args.

Args is very simple to use. You simply construct the Args class with the
input arguments and a format string, and then query the Args instance for
the values of the arguments. Consider the following simple example:

Listing 14-1 Simple use of Args

Click here to view code image

          public static void main(String[] args) {
              try {
                  Args arg = new Args("l,p#,d*", args);
                  boolean logging = arg.getBoolean('l');
                  int port = arg.getInt('p');
                  String directory = arg.getString('d');
                  executeApplication(logging, port, directory);
              } catch (ArgsException e) {
                  System.out.printf("Argument error: %s\n",

     e.errorMessage());
              }

          }

You can see how simple this is. We just create an instance of the Args
class with two parameters. The first parameter is the format, or schema,
string: "l,p#,d*." It defines three command-line arguments. The first, -
l, is a boolean argument. The second, -p, is an integer argument. The
third, -d, is a string argument. The second parameter to the Args
constructor is simply the array of command-line argument passed into
main.

If the constructor returns without throwing an ArgsException, then the
incoming command-line was parsed, and the Args instance is ready to be
queried. Methods like getBoolean, getInteger, and getString
allow us to access the values of the arguments by their names.

If there is a problem, either in the format string or in the command-line
arguments themselves, an ArgsException will be thrown. A convenient
description of what went wrong can be retrieved from the errorMessage
method of the exception.
Args Implementation

Listing 14-2 is the implementation of the Args class. Please read it very
carefully. I worked hard on the style and structure and hope it is worth
emulating.

Notice that you can read this code from the top to the bottom without a lot
of jumping around or looking ahead. The one thing you may have had to
look ahead for is the definition of ArgumentMarshaler, which I left
out intentionally. Having read this code carefully, you should understand
what the ArgumentMarshaler interface is and what its derivatives do.
I'll show a few of them to you now (Listing 14-3 through Listing 14-6).

Listing 14-3 ArgumentMarshaler.java

          public interface ArgumentMarshaler {
              void set(Iterator<String> currentArgument) throws

     ArgsException;
          }

     public class BooleanArgumentMarshaler implements
     ArgumentMarshaler {

         private boolean booleanValue = false;

         public void set(Iterator<String> currentArgument) throws
     ArgsException {

            booleanValue = true;
         }

         public static boolean getValue(ArgumentMarshaler am) {
            if (am != null && am instanceof BooleanArgumentMarshaler)
                return ((BooleanArgumentMarshaler) am).booleanValue;
            else
                return false;

         }
     }

Listing 14-5 StringArgumentMarshaler.java

     import static
     com.objectmentor.utilities.args.ArgsException.ErrorCode.*;

public class StringArgumentMarshaler implements
ArgumentMarshaler {

   private String stringValue =

   public void set(Iterator<String> currentArgument)  throws
ArgsException {

       try {
          stringValue = currentArgument.next();

       } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
          throw new ArgsException(MISSING_STRING);

       }
   }

public static String getValue(ArgumentMarshaler am) {
   if (am != null && am instanceof StringArgumentMarshaler)
       return ((StringArgumentMarshaler) am).stringValue;
            else
                return "";

         }
     }

The other ArgumentMarshaler derivatives simply replicate this pattern
for doubles and String arrays and would serve to clutter this chapter.
I'll leave them to you as an exercise.

One other bit of information might be troubling you: the definition of the
error code constants. They are in the ArgsException class (Listing 147).

                  try {

                     parameter = currentArgument.next();

}
It's remarkable how much code is required to flesh out the details of this
simple concept. One of the reasons for this is that we are using a
particularly wordy language. Java, being a statically typed language,
requires a lot of words in order to satisfy the type system. In a language like
Ruby, Python, or Smalltalk, this program is much smaller.1

1. I recently rewrote this module in Ruby. It was 1/7th the size and had a subtly better structure.

Please read the code over one more time. Pay special attention to the way
things are named, the size of the functions, and the formatting of the code.
If you are an experienced programmer, you may have some quibbles here
and there with various parts of the style or structure. Overall, however, I
hope you conclude that this program is nicely written and has a clean
structure.

For example, it should be obvious how you would add a new argument
type, such as a date argument or a complex number argument, and that such
an addition would require a trivial amount of effort. In short, it would
simply require a new derivative of Argument-Marshaler, a new
getXXX function, and a new case statement in the
parseSchemaElement function. There would also probably be a new
ArgsException.ErrorCode and a new error message.

How Did I Do This?

Let me set your mind at rest. I did not simply write this program from
beginning to end in its current form. More importantly, I am not expecting
you to be able to write clean and elegant programs in one pass. If we have
learned anything over the last couple of decades, it is that programming is a
craft more than it is a science. To write clean code, you must first write
dirty code and then clean it.

This should not be a surprise to you. We learned this truth in grade school
when our teachers tried (usually in vain) to get us to write rough drafts of
our compositions. The process, they told us, was that we should write a
rough draft, then a second draft, then several subsequent drafts until we had
our final version. Writing clean compositions, they tried to tell us, is a
matter of successive refinement.

Most freshman programmers (like most grade-schoolers) don't follow this
advice particularly well. They believe that the primary goal is to get the
program working. Once it's "working," they move on to the next task,
leaving the "working" program in whatever state they finally got it to
"work." Most seasoned programmers know that this is professional suicide.
Args: The Rough Draft

Listing 14-8 shows an earlier version of the Args class. It "works." And
it's messy.

I hope your initial reaction to this mass of code is "I'm certainly glad he
didn't leave it like that!" If you feel like this, then remember that's how
other people are going to feel about code that you leave in rough-draft form.

Actually "rough draft" is probably the kindest thing you can say about this
code. It's clearly a work in progress. The sheer number of instance variables
is daunting. The odd strings like "TILT," the HashSets and TreeSets,
and the try-catch-catch blocks all add up to a festering pile.

I had not wanted to write a festering pile. Indeed, I was trying to keep
things reasonably well organized. You can probably tell that from my
choice of function and variable names and the fact that there is a crude
structure to the program. But, clearly, I had let the problem get away from
me.

The mess built gradually. Earlier versions had not been nearly so nasty. For
example, Listing 14-9 shows an earlier version in which only Boolean
arguments were working.

Although you can find plenty to complain about in this code, it's really not
that bad. It's compact and simple and easy to understand. However, within
this code it is easy to see the seeds of the later festering pile. It's quite clear
how this grew into the latter mess.

Notice that the latter mess has only two more argument types than this:
String and integer. The addition of just two more argument types had
a massively negative impact on the code. It converted it from something
that would have been reasonably maintainable into something that I would
expect to become riddled with bugs and warts.

I added the two argument types incrementally. First, I added the String
argument, which yielded this:

You can see that this is starting to get out of hand. It's still not horrible, but
the mess is certainly starting to grow. It's a pile, but it's not festering quite
yet. It took the addition of the integer argument type to get this pile really
fermenting and festering.

So I Stopped

I had at least two more argument types to add, and I could tell that they
would make things much worse. If I bulldozed my way forward, I could
probably get them to work, but I'd leave behind a mess that was too large to
fix. If the structure of this code was ever going to be maintainable, now was
the time to fix it.

So I stopped adding features and started refactoring. Having just added the
String and integer arguments, I knew that each argument type
required new code in three major places. First, each argument type required
some way to parse its schema element in order to select the HashMap for
that type. Next, each argument type needed to be parsed in the commandline strings and converted to its true type. Finally, each argument type
needed a getXXX method so that it could be returned to the caller as its
true type.

Many different types, all with similar methods--that sounds like a class to
me. And so the ArgumentMarshaler concept was born.

On Incrementalism

One of the best ways to ruin a program is to make massive changes to its
structure in the name of improvement. Some programs never recover from
such "improvements." The problem is that it's very hard to get the program
working the same way it worked before the "improvement."
Args: The Rough Draft

To avoid this, I use the discipline of Test-Driven Development (TDD). One
of the central doctrines of this approach is to keep the system running at all
times. In other words, using TDD, I am not allowed to make a change to the
system that breaks that system. Every change I make must keep the system
working as it worked before.

To achieve this, I need a suite of automated tests that I can run on a whim
and that verifies that the behavior of the system is unchanged. For the Args
class I had created a suite of unit and acceptance tests while I was building
the festering pile. The unit tests were written in Java and administered by
JUnit. The acceptance tests were written as wiki pages in FitNesse. I
could run these tests any time I wanted, and if they passed, I was confident
that the system was working as I specified.

So I proceeded to make a large number of very tiny changes. Each change
moved the structure of the system toward the ArgumentMarshaler
concept. And yet each change kept the system working. The first change I
made was to add the skeleton of the ArgumentMarshaller to the end
of the festering pile (Listing 14-11).

Listing 14-11 ArgumentMarshaller appended to
Args.java

          private class ArgumentMarshaler }
                  private boolean booleanValue = false;

                  public void setBoolean(boolean value) {
                     booleanValue = value;

                  }

                  public boolean getBoolean() {return booleanValue;}
              }

              private class BooleanArgumentMarshaler extends
     ArgumentMarshaler {

              }

              private class StringArgumentMarshaler extends
     ArgumentMarshaler {
              }

              private class IntegerArgumentMarshaler extends
     ArgumentMarshaler {

              }
          }

Clearly, this wasn't going to break anything. So then I made the simplest
modification I could, one that would break as little as possible. I changed
the HashMap for the Boolean arguments to take an
ArgumentMarshaler.

Click here to view code image

          private Map<Character, ArgumentMarshaler> booleanArgs =
              new HashMap<Character, ArgumentMarshaler>();

This broke a few statements, which I quickly fixed.

Click here to view code image

          ...
              private void parseBooleanSchemaElement(char elementId) {
                  booleanArgs.put(elementId, new

     BooleanArgumentMarshaler());
              }

          ..
              private void setBooleanArg(char argChar, boolean value) {
                  booleanArgs.get(argChar).setBoolean(value);
              }

          ...
              public boolean getBoolean(char arg) {
                  return falseIfNull(booleanArgs.get(arg).getBoolean());

          }

Notice how these changes are in exactly the areas that I mentioned before:
the parse, set, and get for the argument type. Unfortunately, small as
this change was, some of the tests started failing. If you look carefully at
getBoolean, you'll see that if you call it with 'y,' but there is no y
argument, then booleanArgs.get('y') will return null, and the
function will throw a NullPointerException. The falseIfNull
function had been used to protect against this, but the change I made caused
that function to become irrelevant.

Incrementalism demanded that I get this working quickly before making
any other changes. Indeed, the fix was not too difficult. I just had to move
the check for null. It was no longer the boolean being null that I
needed to check; it was the ArgumentMarshaller.

First, I removed the falseIfNull call in the getBoolean function. It
was useless now, so I also eliminated the function itself. The tests still failed
in the same way, so I was confident that I hadn't introduced any new errors.

          public boolean getBoolean(char arg) {
              return booleanArgs.get(arg).getBoolean();

          }

Next, I split the function into two lines and put the
ArgumentMarshaller into its own variable named
argumentMarshaller. I didn't care for the long variable name; it was
badly redundant and cluttered up the function. So I shortened it to am [N5].

          public boolean getBoolean(char arg) {
              Args.ArgumentMarshaler am = booleanArgs.get(arg);
              return am.getBoolean();

          }

And then I put in the null detection logic.

          }
String Arguments

Addin_g String arguments was very similar to adding boolean
arguments. I had to change the HashMap and get the parse, set, and
get functions working. There shouldn't be any surprises in what follows
except, perhaps, that I seem to be putting all the marshalling
implementation in the ArgumentMarshaller base class instead of
distributing it to the derivatives.

          private Map<Character, ArgumentMarshaler> stringArgs =
                  new HashMap<Character, ArgumentMarshaler>();

         ...
          private void parseStringSchemaElement(char elementId) {
              stringArgs.put(elementId, new StringArgumentMarshaler());
          }

         ...
          private void setStringArg(char argChar) throws ArgsException

     {
            currentArgument++;
            try {
                stringArgs.get(argChar).setString(args[currentArgument]);
            } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
                valid = false;
                errorArgumentId = argChar;
                errorCode = ErrorCode.MISSING_STRING;
                throw new ArgsException();
            }

          }
         ...

          public String getString(char arg) {
              Args.ArgumentMarshaler am = stringArgs.get(arg);
              return am == null ? " " : am.getString();

          }
         ...
         private class ArgumentMarshaler {

            private boolean booleanValue = false;
            private String stringValue;

            public void setBoolean(boolean value) {
                booleanValue = value;

            }

            public boolean getBoolean() {
                return booleanValue;

            }
            public void setString(String s) {
                stringValue = s;

            }
            public String getString() {

                return stringValue == null ? " " : stringValue;
            }
         }

Again, these changes were made one at a time and in such a way that the
tests kept running, if not passing. When a test broke, I made sure to get it
passing again before continuing with the next change.

By now you should be able to see my intent. Once I get all the current
marshalling behavior into the ArgumentMarshaler base class, I'm
going to start pushing that behavior down into the derivatives. This will
allow me to keep everything running while I gradually change the shape of
this program.

The obvious next step was to move the int argument functionality into the
ArgumentMarshaler. Again, there weren't any surprises.

          private Map<Character, ArgumentMarshaler> intArgs =
                   new HashMap<Character, ArgumentMarshaler>();

          ...
          private void parseIntegerSchemaElement(char elementId) {

              intArgs.put(elementId, new IntegerArgumentMarshaler());
          }
         ...

          private void setIntArg(char argChar) throws ArgsException {
              currentArgument++;
              String parameter = null;
              try {
                  parameter = args[currentArgument];
                  intArgs.get(argChar).setInteger(Integer.parseInt(paramete

     r));
              } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
                  valid = false;
                  errorArgumentId = argChar;
                  errorCode = ErrorCode.MISSING_INTEGER;
                  throw new ArgsException();
              } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                  valid = false;
                  errorArgumentId = argChar;
                  errorParameter = parameter;
                  errorCode = ErrorCode.INVALID_INTEGER;
                  throw new ArgsException();
              }
          }
       ...
          public int getInt(char arg) {
              Args.ArgumentMarshaler am = intArgs.get(arg);
              return am == null ? 0 : am.getInteger();
          }
         ...
          private class ArgumentMarshaler {
              private boolean booleanValue = false;
              private String stringValue;
              private int integerValue;
              public void setBoolean(boolean value) {
                  booleanValue = value;
              }

              public boolean getBoolean() {
                return booleanValue;

              }

              public void setString(String s) {
                  stringValue = s;

              }

              public String getString() {
                  return stringValue == null ? " ": stringValue;

              }
              public void setInteger(int i) {

                  integerValue = i;
              }
              public int getInteger() {

                  return integerValue;
              }
          }

With all the marshalling moved to the ArgumentMarshaler, I started
pushing functionality into the derivatives. The first step was to move the
setBoolean function into the BooleanArgumentMarshaller and
make sure it got called correctly. So I created an abstract set method.

Click here to view code image

          private abstract class ArgumentMarshaler {
              protected boolean booleanValue = false;
              private String stringValue;
              private int integerValue;

              public void setBoolean(boolean value) {
   booleanValue = value;
}
public boolean getBoolean() {

   return booleanValue;
}

public void setString(String s) {
   stringValue = s;

}

public String getString() {
   return stringValue == null ? " " : stringValue;

}

public void setInteger(int i) {
   integerValue = i;

}

public int getInteger() {
   return integerValue;

}

   public abstract void set(String s);
}

Then I implemented the set method in
BooleanArgumentMarshaller.

     private class BooleanArgumentMarshaler  extends
ArgumentMarshaler {

         public void set(String s) {
            booleanValue = true;

         }
     }

And finally I replaced the call to setBoolean with a call to set.

Click here to view code image

          private void setBooleanArg(char argChar, boolean value) {
                  booleanArgs.get(argChar) .set("true");

                }

The tests all still passed. Because this change caused set to be deployed to
the Boolean-ArgumentMarshaler, I removed the setBoolean
method from the ArgumentMarshaler base class.
Notice that the abstract set function takes a String argument, but the
implementation in the BooleanArgumentMarshaller does not use it.
I put that argument in there because I knew that the
StringArgumentMarshaller and
IntegerArgumentMarshaller would use it.

Next, I wanted to deploy the get method into
BooleanArgumentMarshaler. Deploying get functions is always
ugly because the return type has to be Object, and in this case needs to be
cast to a Boolean.

Click here to view code image

          public boolean getBoolean(char arg) {
                  Args.ArgumentMarshaler am = booleanArgs.get(arg);
                  return am != null && (Boolean)am.get();

              }

Just to get this to compile, I added the get function to the
ArgumentMarshaler.

          private abstract class ArgumentMarshaler {
                  ...

                  public Object get() {
                     return null;

                  }
          }

This compiled and obviously failed the tests. Getting the tests working
again was simply a matter of making get abstract and implementing it in
BooleanAgumentMarshaler.

          private abstract class ArgumentMarshaler {
                  protected boolean booleanValue = false;
                  ...

                  public abstract Object get();
              }

              private class BooleanArgumentMarshaler extends
     ArgumentMarshaler {

                  public void set(String s) {
                     booleanValue = true;
                  }

                  public Object get() {
                     return booleanValue;

                  }
          }

Once again the tests passed. So both get and set deploy to the
BooleanArgumentMarshaler! This allowed me to remove the old
getBoolean function from ArgumentMarshaler, move the protected
booleanValue variable down to BooleanArgumentMarshaler,
and make it private.

I did the same pattern of changes for Strings. I deployed both set and
get, deleted the unused functions, and moved the variables.

          private void setStringArg(char argChar) throws ArgsException
     {

              currentArgument++;
              try {

                  stringArgs.get(argChar).set(args[currentArgument]);
              } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {

                  valid = false;
                  errorArgumentId = argChar;
                  errorCode = ErrorCode.MISSING_STRING;
                  throw new ArgsException();
              }
          }
          ...
              public String getString(char arg) {
                  Args.ArgumentMarshaler am = stringArgs.get(arg);
                  return am == null ? " " : (String) am.get();
              }
          ...
              private abstract class ArgumentMarshaler {
                  private int integerValue;

                  public void setInteger(int i) {
                     integerValue = i;

                  }

                  public int getInteger() {
                     return integerValue;

                  }

                  public abstract void set(String s);
                  public abstract Object get();
              }

              private class BooleanArgumentMarshaler extends
     ArgumentMarshaler {

                  private boolean booleanValue = false;

                  public void set(String s) {
                     booleanValue = true;

                  }

                  public Object get() {
                     return booleanValue;

                  }
              }

              private class StringArgumentMarshaler extends
     ArgumentMarshaler {

                  private String stringValue = " ";

                  public void set(String s) {
                     stringValue = s;

                  }

                  public Object get() {
                     return stringValue;

                  }
              }

              private class IntegerArgumentMarshaler extends
     ArgumentMarshaler {

                  public void set(String s) {
                  }

                  public Object get() {
                     return null;

                  }
              }
          }

Finally, I repeated the process for integers. This was just a little more
complicated because integers needed to be parsed, and the parse
operation can throw an exception. But the result is better because the whole
concept of NumberFormatException got buried in the
IntegerArgumentMarshaler.

     private boolean isIntArg(char argChar) {return
intArgs.containsKey(argChar);}

         private void setIntArg(char argChar) throws ArgsException {
            currentArgument++;
            String parameter = null;
            try {
                parameter = args[currentArgument];
                intArgs.get(argChar).set(parameter);
            } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
                valid = false;
                errorArgumentId = argChar;
                errorCode = ErrorCode.MISSING_INTEGER;
                throw new ArgsException();
            } catch (ArgsException e) {
                valid = false;
                errorArgumentId = argChar;
                errorParameter = parameter;
                errorCode = ErrorCode.INVALID_INTEGER;
                throw e;
            }

         }
     ...

         private void setBooleanArg(char argChar) {
            try {
                              booleanArgs.get(argChar).set("true");
            } catch (ArgsException e) {
            }

         }
     ...

         public int getInt(char arg) {
            Args.ArgumentMarshaler am = intArgs.get(arg);
            return am == null ? 0 : (Integer) am.get();

         }
     ...

         private abstract class ArgumentMarshaler {
            public abstract void set(String s) throws ArgsException;
            public abstract Object get();

         }
     ...

         private class IntegerArgumentMarshaler extends
ArgumentMarshaler {

            private int intValue = 0;

            public void set(String s) throws ArgsException {
                try {
                    intValue = Integer.parseInt(s);
                } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                    throw new ArgsException();
                }
                  }

                  public Object get() {
                     return intValue;

                  }
              }

Of course, the tests continued to pass. Next, I got rid of the three different
maps up at the top of the algorithm. This made the whole system much
more generic. However, I couldn't get rid of them just by deleting them
because that would break the system. Instead, I added a new Map for the
ArgumentMarshaler and then one by one changed the methods to use
it instead of the three original maps.

          public class Args {
          ...

              private Map<Character, ArgumentMarshaler> booleanArgs =
                  new HashMap<Character, ArgumentMarshaler>();

              private Map<Character, ArgumentMarshaler> stringArgs =
                  new HashMap<Character, ArgumentMarshaler>();

              private Map<Character, ArgumentMarshaler> intArgs =
                  new HashMap<Character, ArgumentMarshaler>();

              private Map<Character, ArgumentMarshaler> marshalers =
                  new HashMap<Character, ArgumentMarshaler>();

          ...
              private void parseBooleanSchemaElement(char elementId) {
                  ArgumentMarshaler m = new BooleanArgumentMarshaler();
                  booleanArgs.put(elementId, m);
                  marshalers.put(elementId, m);
              }

              private void parseIntegerSchemaElement(char elementId) {
                  ArgumentMarshaler m = new IntegerArgumentMarshaler();
                  intArgs.put(elementId, m);
                  marshalers.put(elementId, m);

              }

              private void parseStringSchemaElement(char elementId) {
                  ArgumentMarshaler m = new StringArgumentMarshaler();
                  stringArgs.put(elementId, m);
                  marshalers.put(elementId, m);

              }

Of course the tests all still passed. Next, I changed isBooleanArg from
this:

Click here to view code image
          private boolean isBooleanArg(char argChar) {
              return booleanArgs.containsKey(argChar);

          }

to this:

          private boolean isBooleanArg(char argChar) {
              ArgumentMarshaler m = marshalers.get(argChar);
              return m instanceof BooleanArgumentMarshaler;

          }

The tests still passed. So I made the same change to isIntArg and
isStringArg.

Click here to view code image

          private boolean isIntArg(char argChar) {
              ArgumentMarshaler m = marshalers.get(argChar);
              return m instanceof IntegerArgumentMarshaler;

          }

          private boolean isStringArg(char argChar) {
              ArgumentMarshaler m = marshalers.get(argChar);
              return m instanceof StringArgumentMarshaler;

          }

The tests still passed. So I eliminated all the duplicate calls to
marshalers.get as follows:

Click here to view code image

          private boolean setArgument(char argChar) throws
     ArgsException {

              ArgumentMarshaler m = marshalers.get(argChar);
              if (isBooleanArg(m))

                  setBooleanArg(argChar);
              else if (isStringArg(m))

                  setStringArg(argChar);
              else if (isIntArg(m))

                  setIntArg(argChar);
              else

                  return false;

              return true;
          }

          private boolean isIntArg(ArgumentMarshaler m) {
              return m instanceof IntegerArgumentMarshaler;

          }
          private boolean isStringArg(ArgumentMarshaler m) {
              return m instanceof StringArgumentMarshaler;

          }

          private boolean isBooleanArg(ArgumentMarshaler m) {
              return m instanceof BooleanArgumentMarshaler;

          }

This left no good reason for the three isxxxArg methods. So I inlined
them:

          private boolean setArgument(char argChar) throws
     ArgsException {

              ArgumentMarshaler m = marshalers.get(argChar);
              if (m instanceof BooleanArgumentMarshaler)

                  setBooleanArg(argChar);
              else if (m instanceof StringArgumentMarshaler)

                  setStringArg(argChar);
              else if (m instanceof IntegerArgumentMarshaler)

                  setIntArg(argChar);
              else

                  return false;

              return true;
          }

Next, I started using the marshalers map in the set functions, breaking
the use of the other three maps. I started with the booleans.

          private boolean setArgument(char argChar) throws
     ArgsException {

              ArgumentMarshaler m = marshalers.get(argChar);
              if (m instanceof BooleanArgumentMarshaler)

                  setBooleanArg(m);
              else if (m instanceof StringArgumentMarshaler)

                  setStringArg(argChar);
              else if (m instanceof IntegerArgumentMarshaler)

                  setIntArg(argChar);
              else

                  return false;
                  return true;
              }

                  }

              }

The tests still passed, so I did the same with Strings and Integers.
This allowed me to integrate some of the ugly exception management code

into the setArgument function.

              }
          }

I was close to being able to remove the three old maps. First, I needed to
change the getBoolean function from this:

          public boolean getBoolean(char arg) {
              Args.ArgumentMarshaler am = booleanArgs.get(arg);
              return am != null && (Boolean) am.get();

          }

to this:

          public boolean getBoolean(char arg) {
                  Args.ArgumentMarshaler am = marshalers.get(arg);
                  boolean b = false;
                  try {
                     b = am != null && (Boolean) am.get();
                  } catch (ClassCastException e) {

                     b = false;
                  }
                  return b;
          }

This last change might have been a surprise. Why did I suddenly decide to
deal with the ClassCastException? The reason is that I have a set of
unit tests and a separate set of acceptance tests written in FitNesse. It turns
out that the FitNesse tests made sure that if you called getBoolean on a
nonboolean argument, you got a false. The unit tests did not. Up to this
point I had only been running the unit tests.2

2. To prevent further surprises of this kind, I added a new unit test that invoked all the FitNesse tests.

This last change allowed me to pull out another use of the boolean map:

          private void parseBooleanSchemaElement(char elementId) {
              ArgumentMarshaler m = new BooleanArgumentMarshaler();
   booleanArgs.put(elementId, m);
   marshalers.put(elementId, m);
}

And now we can delete the boolean map.

public class Args {
...

   private Map<Character, ArgumentMarshaler> booleanArgs
   = new HashMap<Character, ArgumentMarshaler>();
   private Map<Character, ArgumentMarshaler> stringArgs =
   new HashMap<Character, ArgumentMarshaler>();
   private Map<Character, ArgumentMarshaler> intArgs =
   new HashMap<Character, ArgumentMarshaler>();
   private Map<Character, ArgumentMarshaler> marshalers =
   new HashMap<Character, ArgumentMarshaler>();
...

Next, I migrated the String and Integer arguments in the same manner
and did a little cleanup with the booleans.

          private void parseBooleanSchemaElement(char elementId) {
              marshalers.put(elementId, new BooleanArgumentMarshaler());

          }
          private void parseIntegerSchemaElement(char elementId) {

              marshalers.put(elementId, new IntegerArgumentMarshaler());
          }

 private void parseStringSchemaElement(char elementId) {
     marshalers.put(elementId, new StringArgumentMarshaler());

 }
...

 public String getString(char arg) {
     Args.ArgumentMarshaler am = marshalers.get(arg);
     try {
         return am == null ? " " : (String) am.get();
     } catch (ClassCastException e) {
         return " ";
     }

 }

public int getInt(char arg)     {
   Args.ArgumentMarshaler am    = marshalers.get(arg);
   try {
       return am == null ? 0 :  (Integer) am.get();
   } catch (Exception e) {
       return 0;
              }
          }
       ...
       public class Args {
       ...
          private Map<Character, ArgumentMarshaler> stringArgs =
          new HashMap<Character, ArgumentMarshaler>();
          private Map<Character, ArgumentMarshaler> intArgs =
          new HashMap<Character, ArgumentMarshaler>();
          private Map<Character, ArgumentMarshaler> marshalers =
          new HashMap<Character, ArgumentMarshaler>();
         ...

Next, I inlined the three parse methods because they didn't do much
anymore:

Click here to view code image

          private void parseSchemaElement(String element) throws
     ParseException {

              char elementId = element.charAt(0);
              String elementTail = element.substring(1);
              validateSchemaElementId(elementId);
              if (isBooleanSchemaElement(elementTail))

                  marshalers.put(elementId, new
     BooleanArgumentMarshaler());

              else if (isStringSchemaElement(elementTail))
                  marshalers.put(elementId, new StringArgumentMarshaler());

              else if (isIntegerSchemaElement(elementTail)) {
                  marshalers.put(elementId, new

     IntegerArgumentMarshaler());
              } else {
                  throw new ParseException(String.format(
                  "Argument: %c has invalid format: %s.", elementId,

     elementTail), 0);
              }

          }

Okay, so now let's look at the whole picture again. Listing 14-12 shows the
current form of the Args class.

After all that work, this is a bit disappointing. The structure is a bit better,
but we still have all those variables up at the top; there's still a horrible
type-case in setArgument; and all those set functions are really ugly.
Not to mention all the error processing. We still have a lot of work ahead of
us.

I'd really like to get rid of that type-case up in setArgument [G23].
What I'd like in setArgument is a single call to
ArgumentMarshaler.set. This means I need to push setIntArg,
setStringArg, and setBooleanArg down into the appropriate
ArgumentMarshaler derivatives. But there is a problem.

If you look closely at setIntArg, you'll notice that it uses two instance
variables: args and currentArg. To move setIntArg down into
BooleanArgumentMarshaler, I'll have to pass both args and
currentArgs as function arguments. That's dirty [F1]. I'd rather pass
one argument instead of two. Fortunately, there is a simple solution. We can
convert the args array into a list and pass an Iterator down to the
set functions. The following took me ten steps, passing all the tests after
each. But I'll just show you the result. You should be able to figure out what
most of the tiny little steps were.

These were simple changes that kept all the tests passing. Now we can start
moving the set functions down into the appropriate derivatives. First, I
need to make the following change in setArgument:

          private boolean setArgument(char argChar) throws
     ArgsException {

              ArgumentMarshaler m = marshalers.get(argChar);
              if (m == null)

                  return false;
              try {

                  if (m instanceof BooleanArgumentMarshaler)
                     setBooleanArg(m);

                  else if (m instanceof StringArgumentMarshaler)
                     setStringArg(m);

                  else if (m instanceof IntegerArgumentMarshaler)
                     setIntArg(m);

                  else
                     return false;

              } catch (ArgsException e) {
                  valid = false;
                  errorArgumentId = argChar;
                  throw e;

              }
              return true;
          }

This change is important because we want to completely eliminate the ifelse chain. Therefore, we needed to get the error condition out of it.

Now we can start to move the set functions. The setBooleanArg
function is trivial, so we'll prepare that one first. Our goal is to change the
setBooleanArg function to simply forward to the
BooleanArgumentMarshaler.

          private boolean setArgument(char argChar) throws
     ArgsException {

                  ArgumentMarshaler m = marshalers.get(argChar);
                  if (m == null)
                     return false;

                  try {
                     if (m instanceof BooleanArgumentMarshaler)
                         setBooleanArg(m, currentArgument);
                     else if (m instanceof StringArgumentMarshaler)
                         setStringArg(m);
                     else if (m instanceof IntegerArgumentMarshaler)
                         setIntArg(m);

                  } catch (ArgsException e) {
                     valid = false;
                     errorArgumentId = argChar;
                     throw e;

                  }
                  return true;
              }
          ---
              private void setBooleanArg(ArgumentMarshaler m,

                                                               Iterator<String>
     currentArgument)

                                                               throws ArgsException {
              try {

                   m.set("true");
              catch (ArgsException e) {
          }
          }

Didn't we just put that exception processing in? Putting things in so you can
take them out again is pretty common in refactoring. The smallness of the
steps and the need to keep the tests running means that you move things
around a lot. Refactoring is a lot like solving a Rubik's cube. There are lots
of little steps required to achieve a large goal. Each step enables the next.

Why did we pass that iterator when setBooleanArg certainly
doesn't need it? Because setIntArg and setStringArg will! And
because I want to deploy all three of these functions through an abstract
method in ArgumentMarshaller, I need to pass it to
setBooleanArg.

So now setBooleanArg is useless. If there were a set function in
ArgumentMarshaler, we could call it directly. So it's time to make that
function! The first step is to add the new abstract method to
ArgumentMarshaler.

Click here to view code image
private abstract class ArgumentMarshaler {
   public abstract void set(Iterator<String> currentArgument)
                                         throws ArgsException;
   public abstract void set(String s) throws ArgsException;
   public abstract Object get();

}

Of course this breaks all the derivatives. So let's implement the new method
in each.

Click here to view code image

     private class BooleanArgumentMarshaler extends
ArgumentMarshaler {

         private boolean booleanValue = false;

         public void set(Iterator<String> currentArgument) throws
ArgsException {

            booleanValue = true;
         }

public void set(String s) {
   booleanValue = true;

}

         public Object get() {              extends
            return booleanValue;

         }
     }
     private class StringArgumentMarshaler
ArgumentMarshaler {

         private String stringValue = "";

         public void set(Iterator<String>  currentArgument)  throws
ArgsException {

         }
         public void set(String s) {

            stringValue = s;
         }
         public Object get() {

            return stringValue;
         }
     }

     private class IntegerArgumentMarshaler extends
ArgumentMarshaler {

         private int intValue = 0;

         public void set(Iterator<String> currentArgument) throws
ArgsException {

         }
   public void set(String s) throws ArgsException {

      try {

         intValue = Integer.parseInt(s);

      } catch (NumberFormatException e) {

         throw new ArgsException();

      }

   }     public Object get() {

      return intValue;

   }

}

And now we can eliminate setBooleanArg!

Click here to view code image

     private boolean setArgument(char argChar) throws
ArgsException {

            ArgumentMarshaler m = marshalers.get(argChar);
            if (m == null)

                return false;
            try {

                if (m instanceof BooleanArgumentMarshaler)
                    m.set(currentArgument);

                else if (m instanceof StringArgumentMarshaler)
                    setStringArg(m);

                else if (m instanceof IntegerArgumentMarshaler)
                    setIntArg(m);

       } catch (ArgsException e) {
          valid = false;
          errorArgumentId = argChar;
          throw e;

       }
       return true;
}

The tests all pass, and the set function is deploying to
BooleanArgumentMarshaler! Now we can do the same for
Strings and Integers.

          private boolean setArgument(char argChar) throws
     ArgsException {

              ArgumentMarshaler m = marshalers.get(argChar);
              if (m == null)

                  return false;
              try {

                  if (m instanceof BooleanArgumentMarshaler)
                     m.set(currentArgument);

                  else if (m instanceof StringArgumentMarshaler)
                m.set(currentArgument);
            else if (m instanceof IntegerArgumentMarshaler)

                m.set(currentArgument);
         } catch (ArgsException e) {

            valid = false;
            errorArgumentId = argChar;
            throw e;
         }
         return true;
     }
 ---
     private class StringArgumentMarshaler extends
ArgumentMarshaler {
         private String stringValue = "";

         public void set(Iterator<String> currentArgument)   throws
ArgsException {

            try {
                stringValue = currentArgument.next();

            } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
                errorCode = ErrorCode.MISSING_STRING;
                throw new ArgsException();

            }
         }

public void set(String s) {
}

   public Object get() {
       return stringValue;

   }
}

     private class IntegerArgumentMarshaler extends
ArgumentMarshaler {

         private int intValue = 0;

     public void set(Iterator<String> currentArgument)  throws
ArgsException {

         String parameter = null;
         try {

            parameter = currentArgument.next();
            set(parameter);
         } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
            errorCode = ErrorCode.MISSING_INTEGER;
            throw new ArgsException();
         } catch (ArgsException e) {
            errorParameter = parameter;
            errorCode = ErrorCode.INVALID_INTEGER;
            throw e;
   }
}

public void set(String s) throws ArgsException {
   try {
       intValue = Integer.parseInt(s);
   } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
       throw new ArgsException();
   }

}

   public Object get() {
       return intValue;

   }
}

And so the coup de grace: The type-case can be removed! Touche!

Click here to view code image

     private boolean setArgument(char argChar) throws
ArgsException {

         ArgumentMarshaler m = marshalers.get(argChar);
         if (m == null)

            return false;
         try {

            m.set(currentArgument);
            return true;
         } catch (ArgsException e) {
            valid = false;
            errorArgumentId = argChar;
            throw e;
         }
     }

Now we can get rid of some crufty functions in
IntegerArgumentMarshaler and clean it up a bit.

Click here to view code image

          private class IntegerArgumentMarshaler extends
     ArgumentMarshaler {

              private int intValue = 0

         public void set(Iterator<String> currentArgument)  throws
ArgsException {

            String parameter = null;
            try {

                parameter = currentArgument.next();
                intValue = Integer.parseInt(parameter);
            } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
       errorCode = ErrorCode.MISSING_INTEGER;
       throw new ArgsException();
   } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
       errorParameter = parameter;
       errorCode = ErrorCode.INVALID_INTEGER;
       throw new ArgsException();
   }
}

   public Object get() {
       return intValue;

   }
}

We can also turn ArgumentMarshaler into an interface.

Click here to view code image

     private interface ArgumentMarshaler {           throws
         void set(Iterator<String> currentArgument)

ArgsException;
         Object get();

     }

So now let's see how easy it is to add a new argument type to our structure.
It should require very few changes, and those changes should be isolated.
First, we begin by adding a new test case to check that the double
argument works correctly.

Click here to view code image

          public void testSimpleDoublePresent() throws Exception {
              Args args = new Args("x##", new String[] {"-x","42.3"});
              assertTrue(args.isValid());
              assertEquals(1, args.cardinality());
              assertTrue(args.has('x'));
              assertEquals(42.3, args.getDouble('x'), .001);

          }

Now we clean up the schema parsing code and add the ## detection for the
double argument type.

Click here to view code image

     private void parseSchemaElement(String element)   throws
ParseException {

         char elementId = element.charAt(0);
         String elementTail = element.substring(1);
         validateSchemaElementId(elementId);
         if (elementTail.length() == 0)

            marshalers.put(elementId, new
BooleanArgumentMarshaler());
         else if (elementTail.equals("*"))
            marshalers.put(elementId, new StringArgumentMarshaler());
         else if (elementTail.equals("#"))
            marshalers.put(elementId, new

IntegerArgumentMarshaler());
         else if (elementTail.equals("##"))
            marshalers.put(elementId, new DoubleArgumentMarshaler());
         else
            throw new ParseException(String.format(
                "Argument: %c has invalid format: %s.", elementId,

elementTail), 0);
     }

Next, we write the DoubleArgumentMarshaler class.

Click here to view code image

     private class DoubleArgumentMarshaler implements
ArgumentMarshaler {

         private double doubleValue = 0;

         public void set(Iterator<String> currentArgument)    throws
ArgsException {

            String parameter = null;
            try {

                parameter = currentArgument.next();
                doubleValue = Double.parseDouble(parameter);
            } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
                errorCode = ErrorCode.MISSING_DOUBLE;
                throw new ArgsException();
            } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                errorParameter = parameter;
                errorCode = ErrorCode.INVALID_DOUBLE;
                throw new ArgsException();
            }
         }

   public Object get() {
       return doubleValue;

   }
}

This forces us to add a new ErrorCode.

Click here to view code image

          private enum ErrorCode {
                  OK, MISSING_STRING, MISSING_INTEGER, INVALID_INTEGER,

     UNEXPECTED_ARGUMENT,
                  MISSING_DOUBLE, INVALID_DOUBLE}
And we need a getDouble function.

Click here to view code image

          public double getDouble(char arg) {
              Args.ArgumentMarshaler am = marshalers.get(arg);
              try {
                  return am == null ? 0 : (Double) am.get();
              } catch (Exception e) {
                  return 0.0;
              }

          }

And all the tests pass! That was pretty painless. So now let's make sure all

the error processing works correctly. The next test case checks that an error

is declared if an unparseable string is fed to a ## argument.

Click here to view code image

          public void testInvalidDouble() throws Exception {
              Args args = new Args("x##", new String[] {"-x","Forty

     two"});
              assertFalse(args.isValid());
              assertEquals(0, args.cardinality());
              assertFalse(args.has('x'));
              assertEquals(0, args.getInt('x'));
                  assertEquals("Argument -x expects a double but was `Forty

     two'.",
                                         args.errorMessage());

          }
       ---

          public String errorMessage() throws Exception {
              switch (errorCode) {
                  case OK:
                     throw new Exception("TILT: Should not get here.");
                  case UNEXPECTED_ARGUMENT:
                     return unexpectedArgumentMessage();
                  case MISSING_STRING:
                     return String.format("Could not find string parameter

     for -%c.",
                                                           errorArgumentId);

                  case INVALID_INTEGER:
                     return String.format("Argument -%c expects an integer

     but was `%s'.",
                                                           errorArgumentId, errorParameter);

                  case MISSING_INTEGER:
                     return String.format("Could not find integer parameter

     for -%c.",
                                                           errorArgumentId);

                  case INVALID_DOUBLE:
                     return String.format("Argument -%c expects a double but
was `%s'.",
                                                      errorArgumentId, errorParameter);

            case MISSING_DOUBLE:
                return String.format("Could not find double parameter

for -%c.",
                                                      errorArgumentId);

         }
         return"";
     }

And the tests pass. The next test makes sure we detect a missing double
argument properly.

Click here to view code image

public void testMissingDouble() throws Exception {    -x.",
   Args args = new Args("x##", new String[]{"-x"});
   assertFalse(args.isValid());
   assertEquals(0, args.cardinality());
   assertFalse(args.has('x'));
   assertEquals(0.0, args.getDouble('x'), 0.01);
   assertEquals("Could not find double parameter for
                           args.errorMessage());

}

This passes as expected. We wrote it simply for completeness.

The exception code is pretty ugly and doesn't really belong in the Args
class. We are also throwing out ParseException, which doesn't really
belong to us. So let's merge all the exceptions into a single
ArgsException class and move it into its own module.

          public class ArgsException extends Exception {
              private char errorArgumentId = '\0';

This is nice. Now the only exception thrown by Args is
ArgsException. Moving ArgsException into its own module
means that we can move a lot of the miscellaneous error support code into
that module and out of the Args module. It provides a natural and obvious
place to put all that code and will really help us clean up the Args module
going forward.

So now we have completely separated the exception and error code from
the Args module. (See Listing 14-13 through Listing 14-16.) This was
achieved through a series of about 30 tiny steps, keeping the tests passing
between each step.

          }

The majority of the changes to the Args class were deletions. A lot of code
just got moved out of Args and put into ArgsException. Nice. We also
moved all the ArgumentMarshaller s into their own files. Nicer!

Much of good software design is simply about partitioning--creating
appropriate places to put different kinds of code. This separation of
concerns makes the code much simpler to understand and maintain.

Of special interest is the errorMessage method of ArgsException.
Clearly it was a violation of the SRP to put the error message formatting
into Args. Args should be about the processing of arguments, not about
the format of the error messages. However, does it really make sense to put
the error message formatting code into ArgsException?

Frankly, it's a compromise. Users who don't like the error messages
supplied by ArgsException will have to write their own. But the
convenience of having canned error messages already prepared for you is
not insignificant.
By now it should be clear that we are within striking distance of the final
solution that appeared at the start of this chapter. I'll leave the final
transformations to you as an exercise.
Conclusion

It is not enough for code to work. Code that works is often badly broken.
Programmers who satisfy themselves with merely working code are
behaving unprofessionally. They may fear that they don't have time to
improve the structure and design of their code, but I disagree. Nothing has a
more profound and long-term degrading effect upon a development project
than bad code. Bad schedules can be redone, bad requirements can be
redefined. Bad team dynamics can be repaired. But bad code rots and
ferments, becoming an inexorable weight that drags the team down. Time
and time again I have seen teams grind to a crawl because, in their haste,
they created a malignant morass of code that forever thereafter dominated
their destiny.

Of course bad code can be cleaned up. But it's very expensive. As code
rots, the modules insinuate themselves into each other, creating lots of
hidden and tangled dependencies. Finding and breaking old dependencies is
a long and arduous task. On the other hand, keeping code clean is relatively
easy. If you made a mess in a module in the morning, it is easy to clean it
up in the afternoon. Better yet, if you made a mess five minutes ago, it's
very easy to clean it up right now.

So the solution is to continuously keep your code as clean and simple as it
can be. Never let the rot get started.
JUnit Internals
JUnit is one of the most famous of all Java frameworks. As frameworks go,
it is simple in conception, precise in definition, and elegant in
implementation. But what does the code look like? In this chapter we'll
critique an example drawn from the JUnit framework.
The JUnit Framework

JUnit has had many authors, but it began with Kent Beck and Eric Gamma
together on a plane to Atlanta. Kent wanted to learn Java, and Eric wanted
to learn about Kent's Smalltalk testing framework. "What could be more
natural to a couple of geeks in cramped quarters than to pull out our laptops
and start coding?"1 After three hours of high-altitude work, they had written
the basics of JUnit.

1. JUnit Pocket Guide, Kent Beck, O'Reilly, 2004, p. 43.

The module we'll look at is the clever bit of code that helps identify string
comparison errors. This module is called ComparisonCompactor.
Given two strings that differ, such as ABCDE and ABXDE, it will expose the
difference by generating a string such as <...B[X]D...>.

I could explain it further, but the test cases do a better job. So take a look at
Listing 15-1 and you will understand the requirements of this module in
depth. While you are at it, critique the structure of the tests. Could they be
simpler or more obvious?

I ran a code coverage analysis on the ComparisonCompactor using
these tests. The code is 100 percent covered. Every line of code, every if
statement and for loop, is executed by the tests. This gives me a high
degree of confidence that the code works and a high degree of respect for
the craftsmanship of the authors.

The code for ComparisonCompactor is in Listing 15-2. Take a moment
to look over this code. I think you'll find it to be nicely partitioned,
reasonably expressive, and simple in structure. Once you are done, then
we'll pick the nits together.

You might have a few complaints about this module. There are some long
expressions and some strange +1s and so forth. But overall this module is
pretty good. After all, it might have looked like Listing 15-3.

Even though the authors left this module in very good shape, the Boy Scout
Rule2 tells us we should leave it cleaner than we found it. So, how can we
improve on the original code in Listing 15-2?

2. See "The Boy Scout Rule" on page 14.

The first thing I don't care for is the f prefix for the member variables [N6].
Today's environments make this kind of scope encoding redundant. So let's
eliminate all the f's.

private  int contextLength;
private  String expected;
private  String actual;
private  int prefix;
private  int suffix;

Next, we have an unencapsulated conditional at the beginning of the
compact function [G28].

Click here to view code image

     public String compact(String message) {
         if (expected == null || actual == null ||

areStringsEqual())
            return Assert.format(message, expected, actual);
              findCommonPrefix();
              findCommonSuffix();
              String expected = compactString(this.expected);
              String actual = compactString(this.actual);
              return Assert.format(message, expected, actual);
          }

This conditional should be encapsulated to make our intent clear. So let's
extract a method that explains it.

Click here to view code image

              public String compact(String message) {
                  if (shouldNotCompact())
                     return Assert.format(message, expected, actual);

                  findCommonPrefix();
                  findCommonSuffix();
                  String expected = compactString(this.expected);
                  String actual = compactString(this.actual);
                  return Assert.format(message, expected, actual);
              }
              private boolean shouldNotCompact() {
                  return expected == null || actual == null ||
     areStringsEqual();
              }

I don't much care for the this.expected and this.actual notation
in the compact function. This happened when we changed the name of
fExpected to expected. Why are there variables in this function that
have the same names as the member variables? Don't they represent
something else [N4]? We should make the names unambiguous.

Click here to view code image

          String compactExpected = compactString(expected);
          String compactActual = compactString(actual);

Negatives are slightly harder to understand than positives [G29]. So let's
turn that if statement on its head and invert the sense of the conditional.

          public String compact(String message) {
              if (canBeCompacted()) {
                  findCommonPrefix();
                  findCommonSuffix();
                  String compactExpected = compactString(expected);
                  String compactActual = compactString(actual);
                  return Assert.format(message, compactExpected,
compactActual);                                      actual);
         } else {                                    && !
            return Assert.format(message, expected,
         }

     }
     private boolean canBeCompacted() {

         return expected != null && actual != null
areStringsEqual();

     }

The name of the function is strange [N7]. Although it does compact the
strings, it actually might not compact the strings if canBeCompacted
returns false. So naming this function compact hides the side effect of
the error check. Notice also that the function returns a formatted message,
not just the compacted strings. So the name of the function should really be
formatCompactedComparison. That makes it read a lot better when
taken with the function argument:

public String formatCompactedComparison(String message) {

The body of the if statement is where the true compacting of the expected
and actual strings is done. We should extract that as a method named
compactExpectedAndActual. However, we want the
formatCompactedComparison function to do all the formatting. The
compact... function should do nothing but compacting [G30]. So let's
split it up as follows:

Click here to view code image

         ...
            private String compactExpected;
            private String compactActual;

         ...

       public String formatCompactedComparison(String message) {
          if (canBeCompacted()) {
              compactExpectedAndActual();
              return Assert.format(message, compactExpected,

compactActual);
          } else {

       return Assert.format(message, expected, actual);
   }
}
            private void compactExpectedAndActual() {
                findCommonPrefix();
                findCommonSuffix();
                compactExpected = compactString(expected);
                compactActual = compactString(actual);

            }

Notice that this required us to promote compactExpected and
compactActual to member variables. I don't like the way that the last
two lines of the new function return variables, but the first two don't. They

aren't using consistent conventions [G11]. So we should change

findCommonPrefix and findCommonSuffix to return the prefix
and suffix values.

         private void compactExpectedAndActual() {
            prefixIndex = findCommonPrefix();
            suffixIndex = findCommonSuffix();
            compactExpected = compactString(expected);
            compactActual = compactString(actual);

         }
         private int findCommonPrefix() {

            int prefixIndex = 0;
            int end = Math.min(expected.length(), actual.length());
            for (; prefixIndex < end; prefixIndex++) {

                if (expected.charAt(prefixIndex) !=
     actual.charAt(prefixIndex))

                   break;
            }
            return prefixIndex;
         }
         private int findCommonSuffix() {
            int expectedSuffix = expected.length() - 1;
            int actualSuffix = actual.length() - 1;
            for (; actualSuffix >= prefixIndex && expectedSuffix >=
     prefixIndex;

                     actualSuffix--, expectedSuffix--) {
                if (expected.charAt(expectedSuffix) !=
     actual.charAt(actualSuffix))

                   break;
            }
            return expected.length() - expectedSuffix;
         }

We should also change the names of the member variables to be a little

more accurate [N1]; after all, they are both indices.
Careful inspection of findCommonSuffix exposes a hidden temporal
coupling [G31]; it depends on the fact that prefixIndex is calculated by
findCommonPrefix. If these two functions were called out of order,
there would be a difficult debugging session ahead. So, to expose this
temporal coupling, let's have findCommonSuffix take the
prefixIndex as an argument.

          private void compactExpectedAndActual() {
              prefixIndex = findCommonPrefix();
              suffixIndex = findCommonSuffix(prefixIndex);
              compactExpected = compactString(expected);
              compactActual = compactString(actual);

          }

          private int findCommonSuffix(int prefixIndex) {
              int expectedSuffix = expected.length() - 1;
              int actualSuffix = actual.length() - 1;
              for (; actualSuffix >= prefixIndex && expectedSuffix >=

     prefixIndex;
                       actualSuffix--, expectedSuffix--) {

                  if (expected.charAt(expectedSuffix) !=
     actual.charAt(actualSuffix))

                     break;
              }
              return expected.length() - expectedSuffix;
          }

I'm not really happy with this. The passing of the prefixIndex
argument is a bit arbitrary [G32]. It works to establish the ordering but does
nothing to explain the need for that ordering. Another programmer might
undo what we have done because there's no indication that the parameter is
really needed. So let's take a different tack.

Click here to view code image

          private void compactExpectedAndActual() {
              findCommonPrefixAndSuffix();
              compactExpected = compactString(expected);
              compactActual = compactString(actual);

          }

          private void findCommonPrefixAndSuffix() {
              findCommonPrefix();
              int expectedSuffix = expected.length() - 1;
              int actualSuffix = actual.length() - 1;
              for (;
                       actualSuffix >= prefixIndex && expectedSuffix >=
     prefixIndex;

                       actualSuffix--, expectedSuffix--
                  ) {

                  if (expected.charAt(expectedSuffix) !=
     actual.charAt(actualSuffix))

                     break;
              }
              suffixIndex = expected.length() - expectedSuffix;
          }

          private void findCommonPrefix() {
              prefixIndex = 0;
              int end = Math.min(expected.length(), actual.length());
              for (; prefixIndex < end; prefixIndex++)
                  if (expected.charAt(prefixIndex) !=

     actual.charAt(prefixIndex))
                     break;

          }

We put findCommonPrefix and findCommonSuffix back the way
they were, changing the name of findCommonSuffix to
findCommonPrefixAnd Suffix and having it call findCommonPrefix before doing anything else. That establishes the temporal nature of
the two functions in a much more dramatic way than the previous solution.
It also points out how ugly findCommonPrefixAndSuffix is. Let's
clean it up now.

Click here to view code image

          private void findCommonPrefixAndSuffix() {
              findCommonPrefix();
              int suffixLength = 1;
              for (; !suffixOverlapsPrefix(suffixLength); suffixLength++)

     {
                  if (charFromEnd(expected, suffixLength) !=
                           charFromEnd(actual, suffixLength))
                     break;

              }
              suffixIndex = suffixLength;
          }

          private char charFromEnd(String s, int i) {
              return s.charAt(s.length()-i);}

          private boolean suffixOverlapsPrefix(int suffixLength) {
              return actual.length() - suffixLength < prefixLength ||
                  expected.length() - suffixLength < prefixLength;
          }

This is much better. It exposes that the suffixIndex is really the length
of the suffix and is not well named. The same is true of the
prefixIndex, though in that case "index" and "length" are synonymous.
Even so, it is more consistent to use "length." The problem is that the
suffixIndex variable is not zero based; it is 1 based and so is not a true
length. This is also the reason that there are all those +1s in
computeCommonSuffix [G33]. So let's fix that. The result is in Listing
15-4.

Listing 15-4 ComparisonCompactor.java (interim)

          public class ComparisonCompactor {
          ...

              private int suffixLength;
          ...

              private void findCommonPrefixAndSuffix() {
                  findCommonPrefix();
                  suffixLength = 0;
                  for (; !suffixOverlapsPrefix(suffixLength);

     suffixLength++) {
                     if (charFromEnd(expected, suffixLength) !=
                             charFromEnd(actual, suffixLength))
                         break;

                  }
            }
            private char charFromEnd(String s, int i) {

                return s.charAt(s.length() - i - 1);
            }
            private boolean suffixOverlapsPrefix(int suffixLength) {

                return actual.length() - suffixLength <= prefixLength ||
                   expected.length() - suffixLength <= prefixLength;

            }
       ...

            private String compactString(String source) {
                String result =
                   DELTA_START +
                   source.substring(prefixLength, source.length() -

     suffixLength) +
                   DELTA_END;

                if (prefixLength > 0)
                   result = computeCommonPrefix() + result;

                if (suffixLength > 0)
                   result = result + computeCommonSuffix();
                return result;
            }
         ...
            private String computeCommonSuffix() {
                int end = Math.min(expected.length() - suffixLength +

                   contextLength, expected.length()
                );
                return

                   expected.substring(expected.length() - suffixLength,
     end) +

                   (expected.length() - suffixLength <
                       expected.length() - contextLength ?
                       ELLIPSIS : "");

            }

We replaced the +1s in computeCommonSuffix with a -1 in
charFromEnd, where it makes perfect sense, and two <= operators in
suffixOverlapsPrefix, where they also make perfect sense. This
allowed us to change the name of suffixIndex to suffixLength,
greatly enhancing the readability of the code.

There is a problem however. As I was eliminating the +1s, I noticed the
following line in compactString:

         if (suffixLength > 0)

Take a look at it in Listing 15-4. By rights, because suffixLength is
now one less than it used to be, I should change the > operator to a >=
operator. But that makes no sense. It makes sense now! This means that it
didn't use to make sense and was probably a bug. Well, not quite a bug.
Upon further analysis we see that the if statement now prevents a zero
length suffix from being appended. Before we made the change, the if
statement was nonfunctional because suffixIndex could never be less
than one!

This calls into question both if statements in compactString! It looks
as though they could both be eliminated. So let's comment them out and run
the tests. They passed! So let's restructure compactString to eliminate
the extraneous if statements and make the function much simpler [G9].

Click here to view code image

          private String compactString(String source) {
                  return
                     computeCommonPrefix() +
                     DELTA_START +
                     source.substring(prefixLength, source.length() -
     suffixLength) +
                     DELTA_END +
                     computeCommonSuffix();
          }

This is much better! Now we see that the compactString function is
simply composing the fragments together. We can probably make this even
clearer. Indeed, there are lots of little cleanups we could do. But rather than
drag you through the rest of the changes, I'll just show you the result in
Listing 15-5.

This is actually quite pretty. The module is separated into a group of

analysis functions and another group of synthesis functions. They are

topologically sorted so that the definition of each function appears just after

it is used. All the analysis functions appear first, and all the synthesis

functions appear last.

If you look carefully, you will notice that I reversed several of the decisions

I made earlier in this chapter. For example, I inlined some extracted

methods back into formatCompactedComparison, and I changed the
sense of the shouldNotBeCompacted expression. This is typical. Often
one refactoring leads to another that leads to the undoing of the first.

Refactoring is an iterative process full of trial and error, inevitably

converging on something that we feel is worthy of a professional.
Conclusion

And so we have satisfied the Boy Scout Rule. We have left this module a bit
cleaner than we found it. Not that it wasn't clean already. The authors had
done an excellent job with it. But no module is immune from improvement,
and each of us has the responsibility to leave the code a little better than we
found it.
Refactoring SerialDate

If you go to http://www.jfree.org/jcommon/index.php, you
will find the JCommon library. Deep within that library there is a package
named org.jfree.date. Within that package there is a class named
SerialDate. We are going to explore that class.
The author of SerialDate is David Gilbert. David is clearly an
experienced and competent programmer. As we shall see, he shows a
significant degree of professionalism and discipline within his code. For all
intents and purposes, this is "good code." And I am going to rip it to pieces.
This is not an activity of malice. Nor do I think that I am so much better
than David that I somehow have a right to pass judgment on his code.
Indeed, if you were to find some of my code, I'm sure you could find plenty
of things to complain about.
No, this is not an activity of nastiness or arrogance. What I am about to do
is nothing more and nothing less than a professional review. It is something
that we should all be comfortable doing. And it is something we should
welcome when it is done for us. It is only through critiques like these that
we will learn. Doctors do it. Pilots do it. Lawyers do it. And we
programmers need to learn how to do it too.

One more thing about David Gilbert: David is more than just a good
programmer. David had the courage and good will to offer his code to the
community at large for free. He placed it out in the open for all to see and
invited public usage and public scrutiny. This was well done!

SerialDate (Listing B-1, page 349) is a class that represents a date in
Java. Why have a class that represents a date, when Java already has
java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar, and others? The
author wrote this class in response to a pain that I have often felt myself.
The comment in his opening Javadoc (line 67) explains it well. We could
quibble about his intention, but I have certainly had to deal with this issue,
and I welcome a class that is about dates instead of times.
First, Make It Work

There are some unit tests in a class named SerialDateTests (Listing
B-2, page 366). The tests all pass. Unfortunately a quick inspection of the
tests shows that they don't test everything [T1]. For example, doing a "Find
Usages" search on the method MonthCodeToQuarter (line 334)
indicates that it is not used [F4]. Therefore, the unit tests don't test it.

So I fired up Clover to see what the unit tests covered and what they didn't.
Clover reported that the unit tests executed only 91 of the 185 executable
statements in SerialDate (~50 percent) [T2]. The coverage map looks
like a patchwork quilt, with big gobs of unexecuted code littered all through
the class.

It was my goal to completely understand and also refactor this class. I
couldn't do that without much greater test coverage. So I wrote my own
suite of completely independent unit tests (Listing B-4, page 374).

As you look through these tests, you will note that many of them are
commented out. These tests didn't pass. They represent behavior that I
think SerialDate should have. So as I refactor SerialDate, I'll be
working to make these tests pass too.

Even with some of the tests commented out, Clover reports that the new
unit tests are executing 170 (92 percent) out of the 185 executable
statements. This is pretty good, and I think we'll be able to get this number
higher.

The first few commented-out tests (lines 23-63) were a bit of conceit on my
part. The program was not designed to pass these tests, but the behavior
seemed obvious [G2] to me. I'm not sure why the
testWeekdayCodeToString method was written in the first place, but
because it is there, it seems obvious that it should not be case sensitive.
Writing these tests was trivial [T3]. Making them pass was even easier; I
just changed lines 259 and 263 to use equalsIgnoreCase.

I left the tests at line 32 and line 45 commented out because it's not clear to
me that the "tues" and "thurs" abbreviations ought to be supported.
The tests on line 153 and line 154 don't pass. Clearly, they should [G2]. We
can easily fix this, and the tests on line 163 through line 213, by making the
following changes to the stringToMonthCode function.

457  if ((result < 1) || (result > 12)) {

        result = -1;

458     for (int i = 0; i < monthNames.length; i++) {

459        if (s.equalsIgnoreCase(shortMonthNames[i])) {

460           result = i + 1;

461           break;

462        }

463        if (s.equalsIgnoreCase(monthNames[i])) {

464           result = i + 1;

465           break;

466        }

467     }

468  }

The commented test on line 318 exposes a bug in the
getFollowingDayOfWeek method (line 672). December 25th, 2004,
was a Saturday. The following Saturday was January 1st, 2005. However,
when we run the test, we see that getFollowingDayOfWeek returns
December 25th as the Saturday that follows December 25th. Clearly, this is
wrong [G3],[T1]. We see the problem in line 685. It is a typical boundary
condition error [T5]. It should read as follows:

685  if (baseDOW >= targetWeekday) {

It is interesting to note that this function was the target of an earlier repair.
The change history (line 43) shows that "bugs" were fixed in
getPreviousDayOfWeek, getFollowingDayOfWeek, and
getNearestDayOfWeek [T6].

The testGetNearestDayOfWeek unit test (line 329), which tests the
getNearestDayOfWeek method (line 705), did not start out as long and
exhaustive as it currently is. I added a lot of test cases to it because my
initial test cases did not all pass [T6]. You can see the pattern of failure by
looking at which test cases are commented out. That pattern is revealing
[T7]. It shows that the algorithm fails if the nearest day is in the future.
Clearly there is some kind of boundary condition error [T5].
The pattern of test coverage reported by Clover is also interesting [T8].
Line 719 never gets executed! This means that the if statement in line 718
is always false. Sure enough, a look at the code shows that this must be
true. The adjust variable is always negative and so cannot be greater or
equal to 4. So this algorithm is just wrong.

The right algorithm is shown below:

              int delta = targetDOW - base.getDayOfWeek();
              int positiveDelta = delta + 7;
              int adjust = positiveDelta % 7;
              if (adjust > 3)

                  adjust -= 7;

              return SerialDate.addDays(adjust, base);

Finally, the tests at line 417 and line 429 can be made to pass simply by
throwing an IllegalArgumentException instead of returning an
error string from weekInMonthToString and relativeToString.

With these changes all the unit tests pass, and I believe SerialDate now
works. So now it's time to make it "right."
Then Make It Right

We are going to walk from the top to the bottom of SerialDate,
improving it as we go along. Although you won't see this in the discussion,
I will be running all of the JCommon unit tests, including my improved unit
test for SerialDate, after every change I make. So rest assured that
every change you see here works for all of JCommon.

Starting at line 1, we see a ream of comments with license information,
copyrights, authors, and change history. I acknowledge that there are certain
legalities that need to be addressed, and so the copyrights and licenses must
stay. On the other hand, the change history is a leftover from the 1960s. We
have source code control tools that do this for us now. This history should
be deleted [C1].

The import list starting at line 61 could be shortened by using
java.text.* and java.util.*. [J1]

I wince at the HTML formatting in the Javadoc (line 67). Having a source
file with more than one language in it troubles me. This comment has four
languages in it: Java, English, Javadoc, and html [G1]. With that many
languages in use, it's hard to keep things straight. For example, the nice
positioning of line 71 and line 72 are lost when the Javadoc is generated,
and yet who wants to see <ul> and <li> in the source code? A better
strategy might be to just surround the whole comment with <pre> so that
the formatting that is apparent in the source code is preserved within the
Javadoc.1

1. An even better solution would have been for Javadoc to present all comments as preformatted, so
that comments appear the same in both code and document.

Line 86 is the class declaration. Why is this class named SerialDate?
What is the significance of the word "serial"? Is it because the class is
derived from Serializable? That doesn't seem likely.

I won't keep you guessing. I know why (or at least I think I know why) the
word "serial" was used. The clue is in the constants
SERIAL_LOWER_BOUND and SERIAL_UPPER_BOUND on line 98
and line 101. An even better clue is in the comment that begins on line 830.
This class is named SerialDate because it is implemented using a
"serial number," which happens to be the number of days since December
30th, 1899.

I have two problems with this. First, the term "serial number" is not really
correct. This may be a quibble, but the representation is more of a relative
offset than a serial number. The term "serial number" has more to do with
product identification markers than dates. So I don't find this name
particularly descriptive [N1]. A more descriptive term might be "ordinal."

The second problem is more significant. The name SerialDate implies
an implementation. This class is an abstract class. There is no need to imply
anything at all about the implementation. Indeed, there is good reason to
hide the implementation! So I find this name to be at the wrong level of
abstraction [N2]. In my opinion, the name of this class should simply be
Date.

Unfortunately, there are already too many classes in the Java library named
Date, so this is probably not the best name to choose. Because this class is
all about days, instead of time, I considered naming it Day, but this name is
also heavily used in other places. In the end, I chose DayDate as the best
compromise.

From now on in this discussion I will use the term DayDate. I leave it to
you to remember that the listings you are looking at still use SerialDate.

I understand why DayDate inherits from Comparable and
Serializable. But why does it inherit from MonthConstants? The
class MonthConstants (Listing B-3, page 372) is just a bunch of static
final constants that define the months. Inheriting from classes with
constants is an old trick that Java programmers used so that they could
avoid using expressions like MonthConstants.January, but it's a bad
idea [J2]. MonthConstants should really be an enum.

Click here to view code image

          public abstract class DayDate implements Comparable,
                                                                                     Serializable {

              public static enum Month {
                  JANUARY(1),
                  FEBRUARY(2),
                  MARCH(3),
                  APRIL(4),
                  MAY(5),
                  JUNE(6),
                  JULY(7),
                  AUGUST(8),
                  SEPTEMBER(9),
                  OCTOBER(10),
                  NOVEMBER(11),
                  DECEMBER(12);

                  Month(int index) {
                     this.index = index;

                  }

                  public static Month make(int monthIndex) {
                     for (Month m : Month.values()) {
                         if (m.index == monthIndex)
                             return m;
                     }
                     throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid month index

     " + monthIndex);
                  }
                  public final int index;

              }

Changing MonthConstants to this enum forces quite a few changes to
the DayDate class and all it's users. It took me an hour to make all the
changes. However, any function that used to take an int for a month, now
takes a Month enumerator. This means we can get rid of the
isValidMonthCode method (line 326), and all the month code error
checking such as that in monthCodeToQuarter (line 356) [G5].

Next, we have line 91, serialVersionUID. This variable is used to
control the serializer. If we change it, then any DayDate written with an
older version of the software won't be readable anymore and will result in
an InvalidClassException. If you don't declare the
serialVersionUID variable, then the compiler automatically generates
one for you, and it will be different every time you make a change to the
module. I know that all the documents recommend manual control of this
variable, but it seems to me that automatic control of serialization is a lot
safer [G4]. After all, I'd much rather debug an
InvalidClassException than the odd behavior that would ensue if I
forgot to change the serialVersionUID. So I'm going to delete the
variable--at least for the time being.2
2. Several of the reviewers of this text have taken exception to this decision. They contend that in an
open source framework it is better to assert manual control over the serial ID so that minor changes
to the software don't cause old serialized dates to be invalid. This is a fair point. However, at least
the failure, inconvenient though it might be, has a clear-cut cause. On the other hand, if the author of
the class forgets to update the ID, then the failure mode is undefined and might very well be silent. I
think the real moral of this story is that you should not expect to deserialize across versions.

I find the comment on line 93 redundant. Redundant comments are just
places to collect lies and misinformation [C2]. So I'm going to get rid of it
and its ilk.

The comments at line 97 and line 100 talk about serial numbers, which I
discussed earlier [C1]. The variables they describe are the earliest and latest
possible dates that DayDate can describe. This can be made a bit clearer
[N1].

Click here to view code image

public static final int EARLIEST_DATE_ORDINAL = 2;  //

1/1/1900

public static final int LATEST_DATE_ORDINAL = 2958465; //

12/31/9999

It's not clear to me why EARLIEST_DATE_ORDINAL is 2 instead of 0.
There is a hint in the comment on line 829 that suggests that this has
something to do with the way dates are represented in Microsoft Excel.
There is a much deeper insight provided in a derivative of DayDate called
SpreadsheetDate (Listing B-5, page 382). The comment on line 71
describes the issue nicely.

The problem I have with this is that the issue seems to be related to the
implementation of SpreadsheetDate and has nothing to do with
DayDate. I conclude from this that EARLIEST_DATE_ORDINAL and
LATEST_DATE_ORDINAL do not really belong in DayDate and should
be moved to SpreadsheetDate [G6].

Indeed, a search of the code shows that these variables are used only within
SpreadsheetDate. Nothing in DayDate, nor in any other class in the
JCommon framework, uses them. Therefore, I'll move them down into
SpreadsheetDate.

The next variables, MINIMUM_YEAR_SUPPORTED, and
MAXIMUM_YEAR_SUPPORTED (line 104 and line 107), provide something
of a dilemma. It seems clear that if DayDate is an abstract class that
provides no foreshadowing of implementation, then it should not inform us
about a minimum or maximum year. Again, I am tempted to move these
variables down into SpreadsheetDate [G6]. However, a quick search
of the users of these variables shows that one other class uses them:
RelativeDayOfWeekRule (Listing B-6, page 390). We see that usage
at line 177 and line 178 in the getDate function, where they are used to
check that the argument to getDate is a valid year. The dilemma is that a
user of an abstract class needs information about its implementation.

What we need to do is provide this information without polluting DayDate
itself. Usually, we would get implementation information from an instance
of a derivative. However, the getDate function is not passed an instance
of a DayDate. It does, however, return such an instance, which means that
somewhere it must be creating it. Line 187 through line 205 provide the
hint. The DayDate instance is being created by one of the three functions,
getPreviousDayOfWeek, getNearestDayOfWeek, or
getFollowingDayOfWeek. Looking back at the DayDate listing, we
see that these functions (lines 638-724) all return a date created by
addDays (line 571), which calls createInstance (line 808), which
creates a SpreadsheetDate! [G7].

It's generally a bad idea for base classes to know about their derivatives. To
fix this, we should use the ABSTRACT FACTORY3 pattern and create a
DayDateFactory. This factory will create the instances of DayDate
that we need and can also answer questions about the implementation, such
as the maximum and minimum dates.

     public abstract class DayDateFactory {
         private static DayDateFactory factory = new

SpreadsheetDateFactory();
         public static void setInstance(DayDateFactory factory) {
            DayDateFactory.factory = factory;
         }

         protected abstract  DayDate  _makeDate(int  ordinal);
         protected abstract  DayDate  _makeDate(int  day, DayDate.Month
month, int year);
         protected abstract  DayDate  _makeDate(int  day, int month,
int year);
              protected abstract DayDate _makeDate(java.util.Date date);
              protected abstract int _getMinimumYear();
              protected abstract int _getMaximumYear();

              public static DayDate makeDate(int ordinal) {
                  return factory._makeDate(ordinal);

              }
              public static DayDate makeDate(int day, DayDate.Month
     month, int year) {

                  return factory._makeDate(day, month, year);
              }

              public static DayDate makeDate(int day, int month, int
     year) {

                  return factory._makeDate(day, month, year);
              }

              public static DayDate makeDate(java.util.Date date) {
                  return factory._makeDate(date);

              }

              public static int getMinimumYear() {
                  return factory._getMinimumYear();

              }

              public static int getMaximumYear() {
                  return factory._getMaximumYear();

              }
          }

This factory class replaces the createInstance methods with
makeDate methods, which improves the names quite a bit [N1]. It
defaults to a SpreadsheetDateFactory but can be changed at any
time to use a different factory. The static methods that delegate to abstract
methods use a combination of the SINGLETON,4 DECORATOR,5 and ABSTRACT
FACTORY patterns that I have found to be useful.

The SpreadsheetDateFactory looks like this.

          public class SpreadsheetDateFactory extends DayDateFactory {
              public DayDate _makeDate(int ordinal) {
                  return new SpreadsheetDate(ordinal);
              }
              public DayDate _makeDate(int day, DayDate.Month month, int
     year) {

                  return new SpreadsheetDate(day, month, year);
              }

              public DayDate _makeDate(int day, int month, int year) {
                  return new SpreadsheetDate(day, month, year);

              }

              public DayDate _makeDate(Date date) {
                  final GregorianCalendar calendar = new

     GregorianCalendar();
                  calendar.setTime(date);
                  return new SpreadsheetDate(
                     calendar.get(Calendar.DATE),
                     DayDate.Month.make(calendar.get(Calendar.MONTH) + 1),
                     calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR));

              }

              protected int _getMinimumYear() {
                  return SpreadsheetDate.MINIMUM_YEAR_SUPPORTED;

              }

              protected int _getMaximumYear() {
                  return SpreadsheetDate.MAXIMUM_YEAR_SUPPORTED;

              }
          }

As you can see, I have already moved the MINIMUM_YEAR_SUPPORTED
and MAXIMUM_YEAR_SUPPORTED variables into SpreadsheetDate,
where they belong [G6].

The next issue in DayDate are the day constants beginning at line 109.
These should really be another enum [J3]. We've seen this pattern before,
so I won't repeat it here. You'll see it in the final listings.

Next, we see a series of tables starting with LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH at line
140. My first issue with these tables is that the comments that describe them
are redundant [C3]. Their names are sufficient. So I'm going to delete the
comments.

There seems to be no good reason that this table isn't private [G8], because
there is a static function lastDayOfMonth that provides the same data.

The next table, AGGREGATE_DAYS_TO_END_OF_MONTH, is a bit more
mysterious because it is not used anywhere in the JCommon framework
[G9]. So I deleted it.

The same goes for
LEAP_YEAR_AGGREGATE_DAYS_TO_END_OF_MONTH.

The next table, AGGREGATE_DAYS_TO_END_OF_PRECEDING_MONTH,
is used only in Spread-sheetDate (line 434 and line 473). This begs
the question of whether it should be moved to SpreadsheetDate. The
argument for not moving it is that the table is not specific to any particular
implementation [G6]. On the other hand, no implementation other than
SpreadsheetDate actually exists, and so the table should be moved
close to where it is used [G10].

What settles the argument for me is that to be consistent [G11], we should
make the table private and expose it through a function like
julianDateOfLastDayOfMonth. Nobody seems to need a function
like that. Moreover, the table can be moved back to DayDate easily if any
new implementation of DayDate needs it. So I moved it.

The same goes for the table,
LEAP_YEAR_AGGREGATE_DAYS_TO_END_OF_MONTH.

Next, we see three sets of constants that can be turned into enums (lines
162-205). The first of the three selects a week within a month. I changed it
into an enum named WeekInMonth.

Click here to view code image

          public enum WeekInMonth {
                  FIRST(1), SECOND(2), THIRD(3), FOURTH(4), LAST(0);
                  public final int index;

                  WeekInMonth(int index) {
                     this.index = index;

                  }
              }

The second set of constants (lines 177-187) is a bit more obscure. The
INCLUDE_NONE, INCLUDE_FIRST, INCLUDE_SECOND, and
INCLUDE_BOTH constants are used to describe whether the defining endpoint dates of a range should be included in that range. Mathematically, this
is described using the terms "open interval," "half-open interval," and
"closed interval." I think it is clearer using the mathematical nomenclature
[N3], so I changed it to an enum named DateInterval with CLOSED,
CLOSED_LEFT, CLOSED_RIGHT, and OPEN enumerators.

The third set of constants (lines 189-205) describe whether a search for a
particular day of the week should result in the last, next, or nearest instance.
Deciding what to call this is difficult at best. In the end, I settled for
WeekdayRange with LAST, NEXT, and NEAREST enumerators.

You might not agree with the names I've chosen. They make sense to me,
but they may not make sense to you. The point is that they are now in a
form that makes them easy to change [J3]. They aren't passed as integers
anymore; they are passed as symbols. I can use the "change name" function
of my IDE to change the names, or the types, without worrying that I
missed some -1 or 2 somewhere in the code or that some int argument
declaration is left poorly described.

The description field at line 208 does not seem to be used by anyone. I
deleted it along with its accessor and mutator [G9].

I also deleted the degenerate default constructor at line 213 [G12]. The
compiler will generate it for us.

We can skip over the isValidWeekdayCode method (lines 216-238)
because we deleted it when we created the Day enumeration.

This brings us to the stringToWeekdayCode method (lines 242-270).
Javadocs that don't add much to the method signature are just clutter [C3],
[G12]. The only value this Javadoc adds is the description of the -1 return
value. However, because we changed to the Day enumeration, the comment
is actually wrong [C2]. The method now throws an
IllegalArgumentException. So I deleted the Javadoc.

I also deleted all the final keywords in arguments and variable
declarations. As far as I could tell, they added no real value but did add to
the clutter [G12]. Eliminating final flies in the face of some conventional
wisdom. For example, Robert Simmons6 strongly recommends us to ". . .
spread final all over your code." Clearly I disagree. I think that there are
a few good uses for final, such as the occasional final constant, but
otherwise the keyword adds little value and creates a lot of clutter. Perhaps I
feel this way because the kinds of errors that final might catch are
already caught by the unit tests I write.

6. [Simmons04], p. 73.

I didn't care for the duplicate if statements [G5] inside the for loop (line
259 and line 263), so I connected them into a single if statement using the
|| operator. I also used the Day enumeration to direct the for loop and
made a few other cosmetic changes.

It occurred to me that this method does not really belong in DayDate. It's
really the parse function of Day. So I moved it into the Day enumeration.
However, that made the Day enumeration pretty large. Because the concept
of Day does not depend on DayDate, I moved the Day enumeration
outside of the DayDate class into its own source file [G13].

I also moved the next function, weekdayCodeToString (lines 272286) into the Day enumeration and called it toString.

Click here to view code image

          public enum Day {
              MONDAY(Calendar.MONDAY),
              TUESDAY(Calendar.TUESDAY),
              WEDNESDAY(Calendar.WEDNESDAY),s
              THURSDAY(Calendar.THURSDAY),
              FRIDAY(Calendar.FRIDAY),
              SATURDAY(Calendar.SATURDAY),
              SUNDAY(Calendar.SUNDAY);

         public final int index;
         private static DateFormatSymbols dateSymbols = new
DateFormatSymbols();

Day(int day) {
   index = day;

}

         public static Day make(int index) throws        index));
IllegalArgumentException {

            for (Day d : Day.values())
                if (d.index == index)
                    return d;

            throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                String.format("Illegal day index: %d.",

         }

public static Day parse(String s) throws
     IllegalArgumentException {
                  String[] shortWeekdayNames =
                     dateSymbols.getShortWeekdays();
                  String[] weekDayNames =
                     dateSymbols.getWeekdays();

                  s = s.trim();
                  for (Day day : Day.values()) {

                     if (s.equalsIgnoreCase(shortWeekdayNames[day.index]) ||
                             s.equalsIgnoreCase(weekDayNames[day.index])) {

                         return day;
                     }
                  }
                  throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                     String.format("%s is not a valid weekday string", s));
                }

                public String toString() {
                   return dateSymbols.getWeekdays()[index];

                }
            }

There are two getMonths functions (lines 288-316). The first calls the
second. The second is never called by anyone but the first. Therefore, I
collapsed the two into one and vastly simplified them [G9],[G12],[F4].
Finally, I changed the name to be a bit more self-descriptive [N1].

Click here to view code image

          public static String[] getMonthNames() {
              return dateFormatSymbols.getMonths();

          }

The isValidMonthCode function (lines 326-346) was made irrelevant
by the Month enum, so I deleted it [G9].

The monthCodeToQuarter function (lines 356-375) smells of FEATURE
ENVY7 [G14] and probably belongs in the Month enum as a method named
quarter. So I replaced it.

7. [Refactoring].

Click here to view code image

          public int quarter() {
              return 1 + (index-1)/3;

          }
This made the Month enum big enough to be in its own class. So I moved
it out of DayDate to be consistent with the Day enum [G11],[G13].

The next two methods are named monthCodeToString (lines 377426). Again, we see the pattern of one method calling its twin with a flag. It
is usually a bad idea to pass a flag as an argument to a function, especially
when that flag simply selects the format of the output [G15]. I renamed,
simplified, and restructured these functions and moved them into the
Month enum [N1],[N3],[C3],[G14].

          public String toString() {
              return dateFormatSymbols.getMonths()[index - 1];

          }

          public String toShortString() {
              return dateFormatSymbols.getShortMonths()[index - 1];

          }

The next method is stringToMonthCode (lines 428-472). I renamed it,
moved it into the Month enum, and simplified it [N1],[N3],[C3],[G14],
[G12].

          public static Month parse(String s) {
              s = s.trim();
              for (Month m : Month.values())
                  if (m.matches(s))
                     return m;

              try {
                  return make(Integer.parseInt(s));

              }
              catch (NumberFormatException e) {}
              throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid month " + s);
          }

          private boolean matches(String s) {
              return s.equalsIgnoreCase(toString()) ||
                           s.equalsIgnoreCase(toShortString());

          }

The isLeapYear method (lines 495-517) can be made a bit more
expressive [G16].

Click here to view code image
          public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
              boolean fourth = year % 4 == 0;
              boolean hundredth = year % 100 == 0;
              boolean fourHundredth = year % 400 == 0;
              return fourth && (!hundredth || fourHundredth);

          }

The next function, leapYearCount (lines 519-536) doesn't really
belong in DayDate. Nobody calls it except for two methods in
SpreadsheetDate. So I pushed it down [G6].

The lastDayOfMonth function (lines 538-560) makes use of the
LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH array. This array really belongs in the Month
enum [G17], so I moved it there. I also simplified the function and made it a
bit more expressive [G16].

Click here to view code image

          public static int lastDayOfMonth(Month month, int year) {
              if (month == Month.FEBRUARY && isLeapYear(year))
                  return month.lastDay() + 1;
                else
                  return month.lastDay();

          }

Now things start to get a bit more interesting. The next function is
addDays (lines 562-576). First of all, because this function operates on
the variables of DayDate, it should not be static [G18]. So I changed it to
an instance method. Second, it calls the function toSerial. This function
should be renamed toOrdinal [N1]. Finally, the method can be
simplified.

Click here to view code image

          public DayDate addDays(int days) {
              return DayDateFactory.makeDate(toOrdinal() + days);

          }

The same goes for addMonths (lines 578-602). It should be an instance
method [G18]. The algorithm is a bit complicated, so I used EXPLAINING
TEMPORARY VARIABLES8 [G19] to make it more transparent. I also renamed
the method getYYY to getYear [N1].

8. [Beck97].

Click here to view code image
          public DayDate addMonths(int months) {
              int thisMonthAsOrdinal = 12 * getYear() + getMonth().index

     - 1;
              int resultMonthAsOrdinal = thisMonthAsOrdinal + months;
              int resultYear = resultMonthAsOrdinal / 12;
              Month resultMonth = Month.make(resultMonthAsOrdinal % 12 +

     1);

              int lastDayOfResultMonth = lastDayOfMonth(resultMonth,
     resultYear);

              int resultDay = Math.min(getDayOfMonth(),
     lastDayOfResultMonth);

              return DayDateFactory.makeDate(resultDay, resultMonth,
     resultYear);

          }

The addYears function (lines 604-626) provides no surprises over the
others.

Click here to view code image

          public DayDate plusYears(int years) {
              int resultYear = getYear() + years;
              int lastDayOfMonthInResultYear = lastDayOfMonth(getMonth(),

     resultYear);
              int resultDay = Math.min(getDayOfMonth(),

     lastDayOfMonthInResultYear);
              return DayDateFactory.makeDate(resultDay, getMonth(),

     resultYear);
          }

There is a little itch at the back of my mind that is bothering me about
changing these methods from static to instance. Does the expression
date.addDays(5) make it clear that the date object does not change
and that a new instance of DayDate is returned? Or does it erroneously
imply that we are adding five days to the date object? You might not think
that is a big problem, but a bit of code that looks like the following can be
very deceiving [G20].

Click here to view code image

          DayDate date = DateFactory.makeDate(5, Month.DECEMBER, 1952);
          date.addDays(7); // bump date by one week.

Someone reading this code would very likely just accept that addDays is
changing the date object. So we need a name that breaks this ambiguity
[N4]. So I changed the names to plusDays and plusMonths. It seems
to me that the intent of the method is captured nicely by

Click here to view code image

          DayDate date = oldDate.plusDays(5);

whereas the following doesn't read fluidly enough for a reader to simply
accept that the date object is changed:

          date.plusDays(5);

The algorithms continue to get more interesting.
getPreviousDayOfWeek (lines 628-660) works but is a bit
complicated. After some thought about what was really going on [G21], I
was able to simplify it and use EXPLAINING TEMPORARY VARIABLES [G19] to
make it clearer. I also changed it from a static method to an instance method
[G18], and got rid of the duplicate instance method [G5] (lines 997-1008).

Click here to view code image

          public DayDate getPreviousDayOfWeek(Day targetDayOfWeek) {
              int offsetToTarget = targetDayOfWeek.index -

     getDayOfWeek().index;
              if (offsetToTarget >= 0)
                  offsetToTarget -= 7;
              return plusDays(offsetToTarget);

          }

The exact same analysis and result occurred for
getFollowingDayOfWeek (lines 662-693).

Click here to view code image

          public DayDate getFollowingDayOfWeek(Day targetDayOfWeek) {
                  int offsetToTarget = targetDayOfWeek.index -

     getDayOfWeek().index;
                  if (offsetToTarget <= 0)

                     offsetToTarget += 7;
                  return plusDays(offsetToTarget);
              }

The next function is getNearestDayOfWeek (lines 695-726), which
we corrected back on page 270. But the changes I made back then aren't
consistent with the current pattern in the last two functions [G11]. So I
made it consistent and used some EXPLAINING TEMPORARY VARIABLES
[G19] to clarify the algorithm.

Click here to view code image

     public DayDate getNearestDayOfWeek(final Day targetDay)     {
            int offsetToThisWeeksTarget = targetDay.index -
                                                                 + 7)
getDayOfWeek().index;                                            7;
            int offsetToFutureTarget = (offsetToThisWeeksTarget

% 7;
            int offsetToPreviousTarget = offsetToFutureTarget -

   if (offsetToFutureTarget > 3)
       return plusDays(offsetToPreviousTarget);

   else
       return plusDays(offsetToFutureTarget);

}

The getEndOfCurrentMonth method (lines 728-740) is a little strange
because it is an instance method that envies [G14] its own class by taking a
DayDate argument. I made it a true instance method and clarified a few
names.

Click here to view code image

public DayDate getEndOfMonth() {                       year);
       Month month = getMonth();
       int year = getYear();
       int lastDay = lastDayOfMonth(month, year);
       return DayDateFactory.makeDate(lastDay, month,

   }

Refactoring weekInMonthToString (lines 742-761) turned out to be
very interesting indeed. Using the refactoring tools of my IDE, I first
moved the method to the WeekInMonth enum that I created back on page
275. Then I renamed the method to toString. Next, I changed it from a
static method to an instance method. All the tests still passed. (Can you
guess where I am going?)

Next, I deleted the method entirely! Five asserts failed (lines 411-415,
Listing B-4, page 374). I changed these lines to use the names of the
enumerators (FIRST, SECOND, ...). All the tests passed. Can you see
why? Can you also see why each of these steps was necessary? The
refactoring tool made sure that all previous callers of
weekInMonthToString now called toString on the
weekInMonth enumerator because all enumerators implement
toString to simply return their names....

Unfortunately, I was a bit too clever. As elegant as that wonderful chain of
refactorings was, I finally realized that the only users of this function were
the tests I had just modified, so I deleted the tests.

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me! So after
determining that nobody other than the tests called relativeToString
(lines 765-781), I simply deleted the function and its tests.

We have finally made it to the abstract methods of this abstract class. And
the first one is as appropriate as they come: toSerial (lines 838-844).
Back on page 279 I had changed the name to toOrdinal. Having looked
at it in this context, I decided the name should be changed to
getOrdinalDay.

The next abstract method is toDate (lines 838-844). It converts a
DayDate to a java.util.Date. Why is this method abstract? If we
look at its implementation in SpreadsheetDate (lines 198-207, Listing
B-5, page 382), we see that it doesn't depend on anything in the
implementation of that class [G6]. So I pushed it up.

The getYYYY, getMonth, and getDayOfMonth methods are nicely
abstract. However, the getDayOfWeek method is another one that should
be pulled up from SpreadSheetDate because it doesn't depend on
anything that can't be found in DayDate [G6]. Or does it?

If you look carefully (line 247, Listing B-5, page 382), you'll see that the
algorithm implicitly depends on the origin of the ordinal day (in other
words, the day of the week of day 0). So even though this function has no
physical dependencies that couldn't be moved to DayDate, it does have a
logical dependency.

Logical dependencies like this bother me [G22]. If something logical
depends on the implementation, then something physical should too. Also,
it seems to me that the algorithm itself could be generic with a much
smaller portion of it dependent on the implementation [G6].

So I created an abstract method in DayDate named
getDayOfWeekForOrdinalZero and implemented it in
SpreadsheetDate to return Day.SATURDAY. Then I moved the
getDayOfWeek method up to DayDate and changed it to call
getOrdinalDay and getDayOfWeekForOrdinal-Zero.

Click here to view code image

          public Day getDayOfWeek() {
                  Day startingDay = getDayOfWeekForOrdinalZero();
                  int startingOffset = startingDay.index -

     Day.SUNDAY.index;
                  return Day.make((getOrdinalDay() + startingOffset) % 7 +

     1);
              }

As a side note, look carefully at the comment on line 895 through line 899.
Was this repetition really necessary? As usual, I deleted this comment along
with all the others.

The next method is compare (lines 902-913). Again, this method is
inappropriately abstract [G6], so I pulled the implementation up into
DayDate. Also, the name does not communicate enough [N1]. This
method actually returns the difference in days since the argument. So I
changed the name to daysSince. Also, I noted that there weren't any
tests for this method, so I wrote them.

The next six functions (lines 915-980) are all abstract methods that should
be implemented in DayDate. So I pulled them all up from
SpreadsheetDate.

The last function, isInRange (lines 982-995) also needs to be pulled up
and refactored. The switch statement is a bit ugly [G23] and can be
replaced by moving the cases into the DateInterval enum.

Click here to view code image

          public enum DateInterval {
                  OPEN {
                     public boolean isIn(int d, int left, int right) {
                         return d > left && d < right;
                     }
                  },
                  CLOSED_LEFT {
                     public boolean isIn(int d, int left, int right) {
                         return d >= left && d < right;
                     }
                  },
                  CLOSED_RIGHT {
                     public boolean isIn(int d, int left, int right) {
                         return d > left && d <= right;
                     }

                  },
                  CLOSED {

                     public boolean isIn(int d, int left, int right) {
                         return d >= left && d <= right;

                     }
                  };

                  public abstract boolean isIn(int d, int left, int right);
              }

Click here to view code image

          public boolean isInRange(DayDate d1, DayDate d2, DateInterval
     interval) {

                  int left = Math.min(d1.getOrdinalDay(),
     d2.getOrdinalDay());

                  int right = Math.max(d1.getOrdinalDay(),
     d2.getOrdinalDay());

                  return interval.isIn(getOrdinalDay(), left, right);
              }

That brings us to the end of DayDate. So now we'll make one more pass
over the whole class to see how well it flows.

First, the opening comment is long out of date, so I shortened and improved
it [C2].

Next, I moved all the remaining enums out into their own files [G12].

Next, I moved the static variable (dateFormatSymbols) and three static
methods (getMonthNames, isLeapYear, lastDayOfMonth)
into a new class named DateUtil [G6].

I moved the abstract methods up to the top where they belong [G24].

I changed Month.make to Month.fromInt [N1] and did the same for
all the other enums. I also created a toInt() accessor for all the enums
and made the index field private.

There was some interesting duplication [G5] in plusYears and
plusMonths that I was able to eliminate by extracting a new method
named correctLastDayOfMonth, making the all three methods much
clearer.
I got rid of the magic number 1 [G25], replacing it with
Month.JANUARY.toInt() or Day.SUNDAY.toInt(), as
appropriate. I spent a little time with SpreadsheetDate, cleaning up the
algorithms a bit. The end result is contained in Listing B-7, page 394,
through Listing B-16, page 405.

Interestingly the code coverage in DayDate has decreased to 84.9 percent!
This is not because less functionality is being tested; rather it is because the
class has shrunk so much that the few uncovered lines have a greater
weight. DayDate now has 45 out of 53 executable statements covered by
tests. The uncovered lines are so trivial that they weren't worth testing.
Conclusion

So once again we've followed the Boy Scout Rule. We've checked the code
in a bit cleaner than when we checked it out. It took a little time, but it was
worth it. Test coverage was increased, some bugs were fixed, the code was
clarified and shrunk. The next person to look at this code will hopefully
find it easier to deal with than we did. That person will also probably be
able to clean it up a bit more than we did.

Smells and Heuristics

In his wonderful book Refactoring,1 Martin Fowler identified many
different "Code Smells." The list that follows includes many of Martin's
smells and adds many more of my own. It also includes other pearls and
heuristics that I use to practice my trade.

1. [Refactoring].

I compiled this list by walking through several different programs and
refactoring them. As I made each change, I asked myself why I made that
change and then wrote the reason down here. The result is a rather long list
of things that smell bad to me when I read code.
This list is meant to be read from top to bottom and also to be used as a
reference. There is a cross-reference for each heuristic that shows you
where it is referenced in the rest of the text in "Appendix C" on page 409.
Comments

C1: Inappropriate Information

It is inappropriate for a comment to hold information better held in a
different kind of system such as your source code control system, your issue
tracking system, or any other record-keeping system. Change histories, for
example, just clutter up source files with volumes of historical and
uninteresting text. In general, meta-data such as authors, last-modified-date,
SPR number, and so on should not appear in comments. Comments should
be reserved for technical notes about the code and design.

C2: Obsolete Comment

A comment that has gotten old, irrelevant, and incorrect is obsolete.
Comments get old quickly. It is best not to write a comment that will
become obsolete. If you find an obsolete comment, it is best to update it or
get rid of it as quickly as possible. Obsolete comments tend to migrate away
from the code they once described. They become floating islands of
irrelevance and misdirection in the code.

C3: Redundant Comment

A comment is redundant if it describes something that adequately describes
itself. For example:

          i++; // increment i

Another example is a Javadoc that says nothing more than (or even less
than) the function signature:

Click here to view code image

/**                                            sellRequest)
 * @param sellRequest
 * @return
 * @throws ManagedComponentException
 */

public SellResponse beginSellItem(SellRequest
   throws ManagedComponentException

Comments should say things that the code cannot say for itself.
C4: Poorly Written Comment

A comment worth writing is worth writing well. If you are going to write a
comment, take the time to make sure it is the best comment you can write.
Choose your words carefully. Use correct grammar and punctuation. Don't
ramble. Don't state the obvious. Be brief.

C5: Commented-Out Code

It makes me crazy to see stretches of code that are commented out. Who
knows how old it is? Who knows whether or not it's meaningful? Yet no
one will delete it because everyone assumes someone else needs it or has
plans for it.

That code sits there and rots, getting less and less relevant with every
passing day. It calls functions that no longer exist. It uses variables whose
names have changed. It follows conventions that are long obsolete. It
pollutes the modules that contain it and distracts the people who try to read
it. Commented-out code is an abomination.

When you see commented-out code, delete it! Don't worry, the source code
control system still remembers it. If anyone really needs it, he or she can go
back and check out a previous version. Don't suffer commented-out code to
survive.
Environment

E1: Build Requires More Than One Step

Building a project should be a single trivial operation. You should not have
to check many little pieces out from source code control. You should not
need a sequence of arcane commands or context dependent scripts in order
to build the individual elements. You should not have to search near and far
for all the various little extra JARs, XML files, and other artifacts that the
system requires. You should be able to check out the system with one
simple command and then issue one other simple command to build it.

          svn get mySystem
          cd mySystem
          ant all

E2: Tests Require More Than One Step

You should be able to run all the unit tests with just one command. In the
best case you can run all the tests by clicking on one button in your IDE. In
the worst case you should be able to issue a single simple command in a
shell. Being able to run all the tests is so fundamental and so important that
it should be quick, easy, and obvious to do.
Functions

F1: Too Many Arguments

Functions should have a small number of arguments. No argument is best,
followed by one, two, and three. More than three is very questionable and
should be avoided with prejudice. (See "Function Arguments" on page 40.)

F2: Output Arguments

Output arguments are counterintuitive. Readers expect arguments to be
inputs, not outputs. If your function must change the state of something,
have it change the state of the object it is called on. (See "Output
Arguments" on page 45.)

F3: Flag Arguments

Boolean arguments loudly declare that the function does more than one
thing. They are confusing and should be eliminated. (See "Flag Arguments"
on page 41.)

F4: Dead Function

Methods that are never called should be discarded. Keeping dead code
around is wasteful. Don't be afraid to delete the function. Remember, your
source code control system still remembers it.
General

G1: Multiple Languages in One Source File

Today's modern programming environments make it possible to put many
different languages into a single source file. For example, a Java source file
might contain snippets of XML, HTML, YAML, JavaDoc, English,
JavaScript, and so on. For another example, in addition to HTML a JSP file
might contain Java, a tag library syntax, English comments, Javadocs,
XML, JavaScript, and so forth. This is confusing at best and carelessly
sloppy at worst.

The ideal is for a source file to contain one, and only one, language.
Realistically, we will probably have to use more than one. But we should
take pains to minimize both the number and extent of extra languages in our
source files.

G2: Obvious Behavior Is Unimplemented

Following "The Principle of Least Surprise,"2 any function or class should
implement the behaviors that another programmer could reasonably expect.
For example, consider a function that translates the name of a day to an
enum that represents the day.

2. Or "The Principle of Least Astonishment": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
                Principle_of_least_astonishment

Click here to view code image

          Day day = DayDate.StringToDay(String dayName);

We would expect the string "Monday" to be translated to Day.MONDAY.
We would also expect the common abbreviations to be translated, and we
would expect the function to ignore case.

When an obvious behavior is not implemented, readers and users of the
code can no longer depend on their intuition about function names. They
lose their trust in the original author and must fall back on reading the
details of the code.

G3: Incorrect Behavior at the Boundaries
It seems obvious to say that code should behave correctly. The problem is
that we seldom realize just how complicated correct behavior is. Developers
often write functions that they think will work, and then trust their intuition
rather than going to the effort to prove that their code works in all the
corner and boundary cases.

There is no replacement for due diligence. Every boundary condition, every
corner case, every quirk and exception represents something that can
confound an elegant and intuitive algorithm. Don't rely on your intuition.
Look for every boundary condition and write a test for it.

G4: Overridden Safeties

Chernobyl melted down because the plant manager overrode each of the
safety mechanisms one by one. The safeties were making it inconvenient to
run an experiment. The result was that the experiment did not get run, and
the world saw it's first major civilian nuclear catastrophe.

It is risky to override safeties. Exerting manual control over
serialVersionUID may be necessary, but it is always risky. Turning
off certain compiler warnings (or all warnings!) may help you get the build
to succeed, but at the risk of endless debugging sessions. Turning off failing
tests and telling yourself you'll get them to pass later is as bad as pretending
your credit cards are free money.

G5: Duplication

This is one of the most important rules in this book, and you should take it
very seriously. Virtually every author who writes about software design
mentions this rule. Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt called it the DRY3
principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). Kent Beck made it one of the core
principles of Extreme Programming and called it: "Once, and only once."
Ron Jeffries ranks this rule second, just below getting all the tests to pass.

3. [PRAG].

Every time you see duplication in the code, it represents a missed
opportunity for abstraction. That duplication could probably become a
subroutine or perhaps another class outright. By folding the duplication into
such an abstraction, you increase the vocabulary of the language of your
design. Other programmers can use the abstract facilities you create.
Coding becomes faster and less error prone because you have raised the
abstraction level.

The most obvious form of duplication is when you have clumps of identical
code that look like some programmers went wild with the mouse, pasting
the same code over and over again. These should be replaced with simple
methods.

A more subtle form is the switch/case or if/else chain that appears
again and again in various modules, always testing for the same set of
conditions. These should be replaced with polymorphism.

Still more subtle are the modules that have similar algorithms, but that don't
share similar lines of code. This is still duplication and should be addressed
by using the TEMPLATE METHOD,4 or STRATEGY5 pattern.

4. [GOF].
5. [GOF].

Indeed, most of the design patterns that have appeared in the last fifteen
years are simply well-known ways to eliminate duplication. So too the
Codd Normal Forms are a strategy for eliminating duplication in database
schemae. OO itself is a strategy for organizing modules and eliminating
duplication. Not surprisingly, so is structured programming.

I think the point has been made. Find and eliminate duplication wherever
you can.

G6: Code at Wrong Level of Abstraction

It is important to create abstractions that separate higher level general
concepts from lower level detailed concepts. Sometimes we do this by
creating abstract classes to hold the higher level concepts and derivatives to
hold the lower level concepts. When we do this, we need to make sure that
the separation is complete. We want all the lower level concepts to be in the
derivatives and all the higher level concepts to be in the base class.

For example, constants, variables, or utility functions that pertain only to
the detailed implementation should not be present in the base class. The
base class should know nothing about them.
This rule also pertains to source files, components, and modules. Good
software design requires that we separate concepts at different levels and
place them in different containers. Sometimes these containers are base
classes or derivatives and sometimes they are source files, modules, or
components. Whatever the case may be, the separation needs to be
complete. We don't want lower and higher level concepts mixed together.

Consider the following code:

Click here to view code image

          public interface Stack {
              Object pop() throws EmptyException;
              void push(Object o) throws FullException;
              double percentFull();

              class EmptyException extends Exception {}
              class FullException extends Exception {}
          }

The percentFull function is at the wrong level of abstraction. Although
there are many implementations of Stack where the concept of fullness is
reasonable, there are other implementations that simply could not know how
full they are. So the function would be better placed in a derivative interface
such as BoundedStack.

Perhaps you are thinking that the implementation could just return zero if
the stack were boundless. The problem with that is that no stack is truly
boundless. You cannot really prevent an OutOfMemoryException by
checking for

          stack.percentFull() < 50.0.

Implementing the function to return 0 would be telling a lie.

The point is that you cannot lie or fake your way out of a misplaced
abstraction. Isolating abstractions is one of the hardest things that software
developers do, and there is no quick fix when you get it wrong.

G7: Base Classes Depending on Their Derivatives

The most common reason for partitioning concepts into base and derivative
classes is so that the higher level base class concepts can be independent of
the lower level derivative class concepts. Therefore, when we see base
classes mentioning the names of their derivatives, we suspect a problem. In
general, base classes should know nothing about their derivatives.

There are exceptions to this rule, of course. Sometimes the number of
derivatives is strictly fixed, and the base class has code that selects between
the derivatives. We see this a lot in finite state machine implementations.
However, in that case the derivatives and base class are strongly coupled
and always deploy together in the same jar file. In the general case we want
to be able to deploy derivatives and bases in different jar files.

Deploying derivatives and bases in different jar files and making sure the
base jar files know nothing about the contents of the derivative jar files
allow us to deploy our systems in discrete and independent components.
When such components are modified, they can be redeployed without
having to redeploy the base components. This means that the impact of a
change is greatly lessened, and maintaining systems in the field is made
much simpler.

G8: Too Much Information

Well-defined modules have very small interfaces that allow you to do a lot
with a little. Poorly defined modules have wide and deep interfaces that
force you to use many different gestures to get simple things done. A welldefined interface does not offer very many functions to depend upon, so
coupling is low. A poorly defined interface provides lots of functions that
you must call, so coupling is high.

Good software developers learn to limit what they expose at the interfaces
of their classes and modules. The fewer methods a class has, the better. The
fewer variables a function knows about, the better. The fewer instance
variables a class has, the better.

Hide your data. Hide your utility functions. Hide your constants and your
temporaries. Don't create classes with lots of methods or lots of instance
variables. Don't create lots of protected variables and functions for your
subclasses. Concentrate on keeping interfaces very tight and very small.
Help keep coupling low by limiting information.

G9: Dead Code
Dead code is code that isn't executed. You find it in the body of an if
statement that checks for a condition that can't happen. You find it in the
catch block of a try that never throws. You find it in little utility
methods that are never called or switch/case conditions that never
occur.

The problem with dead code is that after awhile it starts to smell. The older
it is, the stronger and sourer the odor becomes. This is because dead code is
not completely updated when designs change. It still compiles, but it does
not follow newer conventions or rules. It was written at a time when the
system was different. When you find dead code, do the right thing. Give it a
decent burial. Delete it from the system.

G10: Vertical Separation

Variables and function should be defined close to where they are used.
Local variables should be declared just above their first usage and should
have a small vertical scope. We don't want local variables declared
hundreds of lines distant from their usages.

Private functions should be defined just below their first usage. Private
functions belong to the scope of the whole class, but we'd still like to limit
the vertical distance between the invocations and definitions. Finding a
private function should just be a matter of scanning downward from the
first usage.

G11: Inconsistency

If you do something a certain way, do all similar things in the same way.
This goes back to the principle of least surprise. Be careful with the
conventions you choose, and once chosen, be careful to continue to follow
them.

If within a particular function you use a variable named response to hold
an HttpServletResponse, then use the same variable name
consistently in the other functions that use HttpServletResponse
objects. If you name a method processVerificationRequest, then
use a similar name, such as processDeletionRequest, for the
methods that process other kinds of requests.
Simple consistency like this, when reliably applied, can make code much
easier to read and modify.

G12: Clutter

Of what use is a default constructor with no implementation? All it serves
to do is clutter up the code with meaningless artifacts. Variables that aren't
used, functions that are never called, comments that add no information,
and so forth. All these things are clutter and should be removed. Keep your
source files clean, well organized, and free of clutter.

G13: Artificial Coupling

Things that don't depend upon each other should not be artificially coupled.
For example, general enums should not be contained within more specific
classes because this forces the whole application to know about these more
specific classes. The same goes for general purpose static functions
being declared in specific classes.

In general an artificial coupling is a coupling between two modules that
serves no direct purpose. It is a result of putting a variable, constant, or
function in a temporarily convenient, though inappropriate, location. This is
lazy and careless.

Take the time to figure out where functions, constants, and variables ought
to be declared. Don't just toss them in the most convenient place at hand
and then leave them there.

G14: Feature Envy

This is one of Martin Fowler's code smells.6 The methods of a class should
be interested in the variables and functions of the class they belong to, and
not the variables and functions of other classes. When a method uses
accessors and mutators of some other object to manipulate the data within
that object, then it envies the scope of the class of that other object. It
wishes that it were inside that other class so that it could have direct access
to the variables it is manipulating. For example:

6. [Refactoring].
Click here to view code image
          public class HourlyPayCalculator {
              public Money calculateWeeklyPay(HourlyEmployee e) {
                  int tenthRate = e.getTenthRate().getPennies();
                  int tenthsWorked = e.getTenthsWorked();
                  int straightTime = Math.min(400, tenthsWorked);
                  int overTime = Math.max(0, tenthsWorked - straightTime);
                  int straightPay = straightTime * tenthRate;
                  int overtimePay =

     (int)Math.round(overTime*tenthRate*1.5);
                  return new Money(straightPay + overtimePay);

              }
          }

The calculateWeeklyPay method reaches into the
HourlyEmployee object to get the data on which it operates. The
calculateWeeklyPay method envies the scope of
HourlyEmployee. It "wishes" that it could be inside
HourlyEmployee.

All else being equal, we want to eliminate Feature Envy because it exposes
the internals of one class to another. Sometimes, however, Feature Envy is a
necessary evil. Consider the following:

Click here to view code image

          public class HourlyEmployeeReport {
              private HourlyEmployee employee ;

              public HourlyEmployeeReport(HourlyEmployee e) {
                  this.employee = e;

              }

              String reportHours() {
                  return String.format(
                     "Name: %s\tHours:%d.%1d\n",
                     employee.getName(),
                     employee.getTenthsWorked()/10,
                     employee.getTenthsWorked()%10);

              }
          }

Clearly, the reportHours method envies the HourlyEmployee class.
On the other hand, we don't want HourlyEmployee to have to know
about the format of the report. Moving that format string into the
HourlyEmployee class would violate several principles of object
oriented design.7 It would couple HourlyEmployee to the format of the
report, exposing it to changes in that format.

7. Specifically, the Single Responsibility Principle, the Open Closed Principle, and the Common
Closure Principle. See [PPP].

G15: Selector Arguments

There is hardly anything more abominable than a dangling false
argument at the end of a function call. What does it mean? What would it
change if it were true? Not only is the purpose of a selector argument
difficult to remember, each selector argument combines many functions into
one. Selector arguments are just a lazy way to avoid splitting a large
function into several smaller functions. Consider:

Click here to view code image

          public int calculateWeeklyPay(boolean overtime) {
              int tenthRate = getTenthRate();
              int tenthsWorked = getTenthsWorked();
              int straightTime = Math.min(400, tenthsWorked);
              int overTime = Math.max(0, tenthsWorked - straightTime);
              int straightPay = straightTime * tenthRate;
              double overtimeRate = overtime ? 1.5 : 1.0 * tenthRate;
              int overtimePay = (int)Math.round(overTime*overtimeRate);
              return straightPay + overtimePay;

          }

You call this function with a true if overtime is paid as time and a half,
and with a false if overtime is paid as straight time. It's bad enough that
you must remember what calculateWeeklyPay(false) means
whenever you happen to stumble across it. But the real shame of a function
like this is that the author missed the opportunity to write the following:

Click here to view code image

          public int straightPay() {
              return getTenthsWorked() * getTenthRate();

          }

          public int overTimePay() {
              int overTimeTenths = Math.max(0, getTenthsWorked() - 400);
              int overTimePay = overTimeBonus(overTimeTenths);
              return straightPay() + overTimePay;

          }

          private int overTimeBonus(int overTimeTenths) {
              double bonus = 0.5 * getTenthRate() * overTimeTenths;
              return (int) Math.round(bonus);
          }

Of course, selectors need not be boolean. They can be enums, integers, or
any other type of argument that is used to select the behavior of the
function. In general it is better to have many functions than to pass some
code into a function to select the behavior.

G16: Obscured Intent

We want code to be as expressive as possible. Run-on expressions,
Hungarian notation, and magic numbers all obscure the author's intent. For
example, here is the overTimePay function as it might have appeared:

Click here to view code image

          public int m_otCalc() {
          return iThsWkd * iThsRte +

              (int) Math.round(0.5 * iThsRte *
                  Math.max(0, iThsWkd - 400)

              );
          }

Small and dense as this might appear, it's also virtually impenetrable. It is
worth taking the time to make the intent of our code visible to our readers.

G17: Misplaced Responsibility

One of the most important decisions a software developer can make is
where to put code. For example, where should the PI constant go? Should
it be in the Math class? Perhaps it belongs in the Trigonometry class?
Or maybe in the Circle class?

The principle of least surprise comes into play here. Code should be placed
where a reader would naturally expect it to be. The PI constant should go
where the trig functions are declared. The OVERTIME_RATE constant
should be declared in the HourlyPay-Calculator class.

Sometimes we get "clever" about where to put certain functionality. We'll
put it in a function that's convenient for us, but not necessarily intuitive to
the reader. For example, perhaps we need to print a report with the total of
hours that an employee worked. We could sum up those hours in the code
that prints the report, or we could try to keep a running total in the code that
accepts time cards.

One way to make this decision is to look at the names of the functions.
Let's say that our report module has a function named getTotalHours.
Let's also say that the module that accepts time cards has a
saveTimeCard function. Which of these two functions, by it's name,
implies that it calculates the total? The answer should be obvious.

Clearly, there are sometimes performance reasons why the total should be
calculated as time cards are accepted rather than when the report is printed.
That's fine, but the names of the functions ought to reflect this. For
example, there should be a computeRunning-TotalOfHours
function in the timecard module.

G18: Inappropriate Static

Math.max(double a, double b) is a good static method. It does
not operate on a single instance; indeed, it would be silly to have to say
new Math().max(a,b) or even a.max(b). All the data that max
uses comes from its two arguments, and not from any "owning" object.
More to the point, there is almost no chance that we'd want Math.max to
be polymorphic.

Sometimes, however, we write static functions that should not be static. For
example, consider:

Click here to view code image

          HourlyPayCalculator.calculatePay(employee, overtimeRate).

Again, this seems like a reasonable static function. It doesn't operate on
any particular object and gets all it's data from it's arguments. However,
there is a reasonable chance that we'll want this function to be polymorphic.
We may wish to implement several different algorithms for calculating
hourly pay, for example, OvertimeHourlyPayCalculator and
StraightTimeHourlyPayCalculator. So in this case the function
should not be static. It should be a nonstatic member function of
Employee.

In general you should prefer nonstatic methods to static methods. When in
doubt, make the function nonstatic. If you really want a function to be
static, make sure that there is no chance that you'll want it to behave
polymorphically.

G19: Use Explanatory Variables

Kent Beck wrote about this in his great book Smalltalk Best Practice
Patterns8 and again more recently in his equally great book Implementation
Patterns.9 One of the more powerful ways to make a program readable is to
break the calculations up into intermediate values that are held in variables
with meaningful names.

8. [Beck97], p. 108.
9. [Beck07].

Consider this example from FitNesse:

Click here to view code image

          Matcher match = headerPattern.matcher(line);
          if(match.find())
          {

              String key = match.group(1);
              String value = match.group(2);
              headers.put(key.toLowerCase(), value);
          }

The simple use of explanatory variables makes it clear that the first matched
group is the key, and the second matched group is the value.

It is hard to overdo this. More explanatory variables are generally better
than fewer. It is remarkable how an opaque module can suddenly become
transparent simply by breaking the calculations up into well-named
intermediate values.

G20: Function Names Should Say What They Do

Look at this code:

          Date newDate = date.add(5);

Would you expect this to add five days to the date? Or is it weeks, or hours?
Is the date instance changed or does the function just return a new Date
without changing the old one? You can't tell from the call what the function
does.
If the function adds five days to the date and changes the date, then it
should be called addDaysTo or increaseByDays. If, on the other
hand, the function returns a new date that is five days later but does not
change the date instance, it should be called daysLater or daysSince.

If you have to look at the implementation (or documentation) of the
function to know what it does, then you should work to find a better name
or rearrange the functionality so that it can be placed in functions with
better names.

G21: Understand the Algorithm

Lots of very funny code is written because people don't take the time to
understand the algorithm. They get something to work by plugging in
enough if statements and flags, without really stopping to consider what is
really going on.

Programming is often an exploration. You think you know the right
algorithm for something, but then you wind up fiddling with it, prodding
and poking at it, until you get it to "work." How do you know it "works"?
Because it passes the test cases you can think of.

There is nothing wrong with this approach. Indeed, often it is the only way
to get a function to do what you think it should. However, it is not sufficient
to leave the quotation marks around the word "work."

Before you consider yourself to be done with a function, make sure you
understand how it works. It is not good enough that it passes all the tests.
You must know10 that the solution is correct.

10. There is a difference between knowing how the code works and knowing whether the algorithm
will do the job required of it. Being unsure that an algorithm is appropriate is often a fact of life.
Being unsure what your code does is just laziness.

Often the best way to gain this knowledge and understanding is to refactor
the function into something that is so clean and expressive that it is obvious
how it works.

G22: Make Logical Dependencies Physical

If one module depends upon another, that dependency should be physical,
not just logical. The dependent module should not make assumptions (in
other words, logical dependencies) about the module it depends upon.
Rather it should explicitly ask that module for all the information it depends
upon.

For example, imagine that you are writing a function that prints a plain text
report of hours worked by employees. One class named
HourlyReporter gathers all the data into a convenient form and then
passes it to HourlyReportFormatter to print it. (See Listing 17-1.)

Listing 17-1 HourlyReporter.java

Click here to view code image

          public class HourlyReporter {
              private HourlyReportFormatter formatter;
              private List<LineItem> page;
              private final int PAGE_SIZE = 55;

              public HourlyReporter(HourlyReportFormatter formatter) {
                  this.formatter = formatter;
                  page = new ArrayList<LineItem>();

              }

              public void generateReport(List<HourlyEmployee> employees)
     {

                  for (HourlyEmployee e : employees) {
                     addLineItemToPage(e);
                     if (page.size() == PAGE_SIZE)
                         printAndClearItemList();

                  }
                  if (page.size() > 0)

                     printAndClearItemList();
              }

              private void printAndClearItemList() {
                  formatter.format(page);
                  page.clear();

              }

              private void addLineItemToPage(HourlyEmployee e) {
                  LineItem item = new LineItem();
                  item.name = e.getName();
                  item.hours = e.getTenthsWorked() / 10;

                  item.tenths = e.getTenthsWorked() % 10;
                  page.add(item);
              }
              public class LineItem {
                  public String name;
                  public int hours;
                  public int tenths;

              }
          }

This code has a logical dependency that has not been physicalized. Can you
spot it? It is the constant PAGE_SIZE. Why should the
HourlyReporter know the size of the page? Page size should be the
responsibility of the HourlyReportFormatter.

The fact that PAGE_SIZE is declared in HourlyReporter represents a
misplaced responsibility [G17] that causes HourlyReporter to assume
that it knows what the page size ought to be. Such an assumption is a
logical dependency. HourlyReporter depends on the fact that
HourlyReportFormatter can deal with page sizes of 55. If some
implementation of HourlyReportFormatter could not deal with such
sizes, then there would be an error.

We can physicalize this dependency by creating a new method in
HourlyReport-Formatter named getMaxPageSize().
HourlyReporter will then call that function rather than using the
PAGE_SIZE constant.

G23: Prefer Polymorphism to If/Else or Switch/Case

This might seem a strange suggestion given the topic of Chapter 6. After
all, in that chapter I make the point that switch statements are probably
appropriate in the parts of the system where adding new functions is more
likely than adding new types.

First, most people use switch statements because it's the obvious brute force
solution, not because it's the right solution for the situation. So this heuristic
is here to remind us to consider polymorphism before using a switch.

Second, the cases where functions are more volatile than types are
relatively rare. So every switch statement should be suspect.

I use the following "ONE SWITCH" rule: There may be no more than one
switch statement for a given type of selection. The cases in that switch
statement must create polymorphic objects that take the place of other such
switch statements in the rest of the system.

G24: Follow Standard Conventions

Every team should follow a coding standard based on common industry
norms. This coding standard should specify things like where to declare
instance variables; how to name classes, methods, and variables; where to
put braces; and so on. The team should not need a document to describe
these conventions because their code provides the examples.

Everyone on the team should follow these conventions. This means that
each team member must be mature enough to realize that it doesn't matter a
whit where you put your braces so long as you all agree on where to put
them.

If you would like to know what conventions I follow, you'll see them in the
refactored code in Listing B-7 on page 394, through Listing B-14.

G25: Replace Magic Numbers with Named Constants

This is probably one of the oldest rules in software development. I
remember reading it in the late sixties in introductory COBOL, FORTRAN,
and PL/1 manuals. In general it is a bad idea to have raw numbers in your
code. You should hide them behind well-named constants.

For example, the number 86,400 should be hidden behind the constant
SECONDS_PER_DAY. If you are printing 55 lines per page, then the
constant 55 should be hidden behind the constant LINES_PER_PAGE.

Some constants are so easy to recognize that they don't always need a
named constant to hide behind so long as they are used in conjunction with
very self-explanatory code. For example:

Click here to view code image

          double milesWalked = feetWalked/5280.0;
          int dailyPay = hourlyRate * 8;
          double circumference = radius * Math.PI * 2;

Do we really need the constants FEET_PER_MILE,
WORK_HOURS_PER_DAY, and TWO in the above examples? Clearly, the
last case is absurd. There are some formulae in which constants are simply
better written as raw numbers. You might quibble about the
WORK_HOURS_PER_DAY case because the laws or conventions might
change. On the other hand, that formula reads so nicely with the 8 in it that
I would be reluctant to add 17 extra characters to the readers' burden. And
in the FEET_PER_MILE case, the number 5280 is so very well known and
so unique a constant that readers would recognize it even if it stood alone
on a page with no context surrounding it.

Constants like 3.141592653589793 are also very well known and easily
recognizable. However, the chance for error is too great to leave them raw.
Every time someone sees 3.1415927535890793, they know that it is , and
so they fail to scrutinize it. (Did you catch the single-digit error?) We also
don't want people using 3.14, 3.14159, 3.142, and so forth. Therefore, it is a
good thing that Math.PI has already been defined for us.

The term "Magic Number" does not apply only to numbers. It applies to
any token that has a value that is not self-describing. For example:

Click here to view code image

          assertEquals(7777, Employee.find("John
     Doe").employeeNumber());

There are two magic numbers in this assertion. The first is obviously 7777,
though what it might mean is not obvious. The second magic number is
"John Doe," and again the intent is not clear.

It turns out that "John Doe" is the name of employee #7777 in a wellknown test database created by our team. Everyone in the team knows that
when you connect to this database, it will have several employees already
cooked into it with well-known values and attributes. It also turns out that
"John Doe" represents the sole hourly employee in that test database. So
this test should really read:

Click here to view code image

          assertEquals(
              HOURLY_EMPLOYEE_ID,
              Employee.find(HOURLY_EMPLOYEE_NAME).employeeNumber());

G26: Be Precise

Expecting the first match to be the only match to a query is probably naive.
Using floating point numbers to represent currency is almost criminal.
Avoiding locks and/or transaction management because you don't think
concurrent update is likely is lazy at best. Declaring a variable to be an
ArrayList when a List will due is overly constraining. Making all
variables protected by default is not constraining enough.

When you make a decision in your code, make sure you make it precisely.
Know why you have made it and how you will deal with any exceptions.
Don't be lazy about the precision of your decisions. If you decide to call a
function that might return null, make sure you check for null. If you
query for what you think is the only record in the database, make sure your
code checks to be sure there aren't others. If you need to deal with currency,
use integers11 and deal with rounding appropriately. If there is the
possibility of concurrent update, make sure you implement some kind of
locking mechanism.

11. Or better yet, a Money class that uses integers.

Ambiguities and imprecision in code are either a result of disagreements or
laziness. In either case they should be eliminated.

G27: Structure over Convention

Enforce design decisions with structure over convention. Naming
conventions are good, but they are inferior to structures that force
compliance. For example, switch/cases with nicely named enumerations are
inferior to base classes with abstract methods. No one is forced to
implement the switch/case statement the same way each time; but the
base classes do enforce that concrete classes have all abstract methods
implemented.

G28: Encapsulate Conditionals

Boolean logic is hard enough to understand without having to see it in the
context of an if or while statement. Extract functions that explain the
intent of the conditional.

For example:

          if (shouldBeDeleted(timer))

is preferable to

Click here to view code image
          if (timer.hasExpired() && !timer.isRecurrent())

G29: Avoid Negative Conditionals

Negatives are just a bit harder to understand than positives. So, when
possible, conditionals should be expressed as positives. For example:

Click here to view code image

          if (buffer.shouldCompact())

is preferable to

Click here to view code image

          if (!buffer.shouldNotCompact())

G30: Functions Should Do One Thing

It is often tempting to create functions that have multiple sections that
perform a series of operations. Functions of this kind do more than one
thing, and should be converted into many smaller functions, each of which
does one thing.

For example:

Click here to view code image

          public void pay() {
              for (Employee e : employees) {
                  if (e.isPayday()) {
                     Money pay = e.calculatePay();
                     e.deliverPay(pay);
                  }
              }

          }

This bit of code does three things. It loops over all the employees, checks to
see whether each employee ought to be paid, and then pays the employee.
This code would be better written as:

Click here to view code image

          public void pay() {
              for (Employee e : employees)
                  payIfNecessary(e);

          }

          private void payIfNecessary(Employee e) {
              if (e.isPayday())
                  calculateAndDeliverPay(e);
          }

          private void calculateAndDeliverPay(Employee e) {
              Money pay = e.calculatePay();
              e.deliverPay(pay);

          }

Each of these functions does one thing. (See "Do One Thing" on page 35.)

G31: Hidden Temporal Couplings

Temporal couplings are often necessary, but you should not hide the
coupling. Structure the arguments of your functions such that the order in
which they should be called is obvious. Consider the following:

Click here to view code image

          public class MoogDiver {
              Gradient gradient;
              List<Spline> splines;

              public void dive(String reason) {
                  saturateGradient();
                  reticulateSplines();
                  diveForMoog(reason);

              }
              ...
          }

The order of the three functions is important. You must saturate the gradient
before you can reticulate the splines, and only then can you dive for the
moog. Unfortunately, the code does not enforce this temporal coupling.
Another programmer could call reticulate-Splines before
saturateGradient was called, leading to an
UnsaturatedGradientException. A better solution is:

Click here to view code image

          public class MoogDiver {
              Gradient gradient;
              List<Spline> splines;

              public void dive(String reason) {
                  Gradient gradient = saturateGradient();
                  List<Spline> splines = reticulateSplines(gradient);
                  diveForMoog(splines, reason);

              }
              ...
          }

This exposes the temporal coupling by creating a bucket brigade. Each
function produces a result that the next function needs, so there is no
reasonable way to call them out of order.

You might complain that this increases the complexity of the functions, and
you'd be right. But that extra syntactic complexity exposes the true
temporal complexity of the situation.

Note that I left the instance variables in place. I presume that they are
needed by private methods in the class. Even so, I want the arguments in
place to make the temporal coupling explicit.

G32: Don't Be Arbitrary

Have a reason for the way you structure your code, and make sure that
reason is communicated by the structure of the code. If a structure appears
arbitrary, others will feel empowered to change it. If a structure appears
consistently throughout the system, others will use it and preserve the
convention. For example, I was recently merging changes to FitNesse and
discovered that one of our committers had done this:

Click here to view code image

          public class AliasLinkWidget extends ParentWidget
          {

              public static class VariableExpandingWidgetRoot {
                  ...

              ...
          }

The problem with this was that VariableExpandingWidgetRoot
had no need to be inside the scope of AliasLinkWidget. Moreover,
other unrelated classes made use of
AliasLinkWidget.VariableExpandingWidgetRoot. These
classes had no need to know about AliasLinkWidget.

Perhaps the programmer had plopped the
VariableExpandingWidgetRoot into AliasWidget as a matter of
convenience, or perhaps he thought it really needed to be scoped inside
AliasWidget. Whatever the reason, the result wound up being arbitrary.
Public classes that are not utilities of some other class should not be scoped
inside another class. The convention is to make them public at the top level
of their package.

G33: Encapsulate Boundary Conditions

Boundary conditions are hard to keep track of. Put the processing for them
in one place. Don't let them leak all over the code. We don't want swarms
of +1s and -1s scattered hither and yon. Consider this simple example
from FIT:

Click here to view code image

          if(level + 1 < tags.length)
          {

              parts = new Parse(body, tags, level + 1, offset + endTag);
              body = null;
          }

Notice that level+1 appears twice. This is a boundary condition that
should be encapsulated within a variable named something like
nextLevel.

Click here to view code image

          int nextLevel = level + 1;
          if(nextLevel < tags.length)
          {

              parts = new Parse(body, tags, nextLevel, offset + endTag);
              body = null;
          }

G34: Functions Should Descend Only One Level of Abstraction

The statements within a function should all be written at the same level of
abstraction, which should be one level below the operation described by the
name of the function. This may be the hardest of these heuristics to interpret
and follow. Though the idea is plain enough, humans are just far too good at
seamlessly mixing levels of abstraction. Consider, for example, the
following code taken from FitNesse:

Click here to view code image

          public String render() throws Exception
          {

              StringBuffer html = new StringBuffer("<hr");
              if(size > 0)
                  html.append(" size=\"").append(size + 1).append("\"");

              html.append(">");

              return html.toString();
          }

A moment's study and you can see what's going on. This function
constructs the HTML tag that draws a horizontal rule across the page. The
height of that rule is specified in the size variable.

Now look again. This method is mixing at least two levels of abstraction.
The first is the notion that a horizontal rule has a size. The second is the
syntax of the HR tag itself. This code comes from the HruleWidget
module in FitNesse. This module detects a row of four or more dashes and
converts it into the appropriate HR tag. The more dashes, the larger the size.

I refactored this bit of code as follows. Note that I changed the name of the
size field to reflect its true purpose. It held the number of extra dashes.

Click here to view code image

          public String render() throws Exception
          {

              HtmlTag hr = new HtmlTag("hr");
              if (extraDashes > 0)

                  hr.addAttribute("size", hrSize(extraDashes));
              return hr.html();
          }

          private String hrSize(int height)
          {

              int hrSize = height + 1;
              return String.format("%d", hrSize);
          }

This change separates the two levels of abstraction nicely. The render
function simply constructs an HR tag, without having to know anything
about the HTML syntax of that tag. The HtmlTag module takes care of all
the nasty syntax issues.

Indeed, by making this change I caught a subtle error. The original code did
not put the closing slash on the HR tag, as the XHTML standard would
have it. (In other words, it emitted <hr> instead of <hr/>.) The
HtmlTag module had been changed to conform to XHTML long ago.
Separating levels of abstraction is one of the most important functions of
refactoring, and it's one of the hardest to do well. As an example, look at
the code below. This was my first attempt at separating the abstraction
levels in the HruleWidget.render method.

Click here to view code image

          public String render() throws Exception
          {

              HtmlTag hr = new HtmlTag("hr");
              if (size > 0) {

                  hr.addAttribute("size", ""+(size+1));
              }
              return hr.html();
          }

My goal, at this point, was to create the necessary separation and get the
tests to pass. I accomplished that goal easily, but the result was a function
that still had mixed levels of abstraction. In this case the mixed levels were
the construction of the HR tag and the interpretation and formatting of the
size variable. This points out that when you break a function along lines
of abstraction, you often uncover new lines of abstraction that were
obscured by the previous structure.

G35: Keep Configurable Data at High Levels

If you have a constant such as a default or configuration value that is known
and expected at a high level of abstraction, do not bury it in a low-level
function. Expose it as an argument to that low-level function called from
the high-level function. Consider the following code from FitNesse:

Click here to view code image

              public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
              {

                  Arguments arguments = parseCommandLine(args);
                  ...
              }

          public class Arguments
          {

              public static final String DEFAULT_PATH = ".";
              public static final String DEFAULT_ROOT = "FitNesseRoot";
              public static final int DEFAULT_PORT = 80;
              public static final int DEFAULT_VERSION_DAYS = 14;
              ...
          }

The command-line arguments are parsed in the very first executable line of
FitNesse. The default values of those arguments are specified at the top of
the Argument class. You don't have to go looking in low levels of the
system for statements like this one:

Click here to view code image

          if (arguments.port == 0) // use 80 by default

The configuration constants reside at a very high level and are easy to
change. They get passed down to the rest of the application. The lower
levels of the application do not own the values of these constants.

G36: Avoid Transitive Navigation

In general we don't want a single module to know much about its
collaborators. More specifically, if A collaborates with B, and B collaborates
with C, we don't want modules that use A to know about C. (For example,
we don't want a.getB().getC().doSomething();.)

This is sometimes called the Law of Demeter. The Pragmatic Programmers
call it "Writing Shy Code."12 In either case it comes down to making sure
that modules know only about their immediate collaborators and do not
know the navigation map of the whole system.

12. [PRAG], p. 138.

If many modules used some form of the statement a.getB().getC(),
then it would be difficult to change the design and architecture to interpose
a Q between B and C. You'd have to find every instance of
a.getB().getC() and convert it to a.getB().getQ().getC().
This is how architectures become rigid. Too many modules know too much
about the architecture.

Rather we want our immediate collaborators to offer all the services we
need. We should not have to roam through the object graph of the system,
hunting for the method we want to call. Rather we should simply be able to
say:

          myCollaborator.doSomething().
Java

J1: Avoid Long Import Lists by Using Wildcards

If you use two or more classes from a package, then import the whole
package with

          import package.*;

Long lists of imports are daunting to the reader. We don't want to clutter up
the tops of our modules with 80 lines of imports. Rather we want the
imports to be a concise statement about which packages we collaborate
with.

Specific imports are hard dependencies, whereas wildcard imports are not.
If you specifically import a class, then that class must exist. But if you
import a package with a wildcard, no particular classes need to exist. The
import statement simply adds the package to the search path when hunting
for names. So no true dependency is created by such imports, and they
therefore serve to keep our modules less coupled.

There are times when the long list of specific imports can be useful. For
example, if you are dealing with legacy code and you want to find out what
classes you need to build mocks and stubs for, you can walk down the list
of specific imports to find out the true qualified names of all those classes
and then put the appropriate stubs in place. However, this use for specific
imports is very rare. Furthermore, most modern IDEs will allow you to
convert the wildcarded imports to a list of specific imports with a single
command. So even in the legacy case it's better to import wildcards.

Wildcard imports can sometimes cause name conflicts and ambiguities.
Two classes with the same name, but in different packages, will need to be
specifically imported, or at least specifically qualified when used. This can
be a nuisance but is rare enough that using wildcard imports is still
generally better than specific imports.

J2: Don't Inherit Constants

I have seen this several times and it always makes me grimace. A
programmer puts some constants in an interface and then gains access to
those constants by inheriting that interface. Take a look at the following
code:

Click here to view code image

          public class HourlyEmployee extends Employee {
              private int tenthsWorked;
              private double hourlyRate;

              public Money calculatePay() {
                  int straightTime = Math.min(tenthsWorked,

     TENTHS_PER_WEEK);
                  int overTime = tenthsWorked - straightTime;
                  return new Money(
                     hourlyRate * (tenthsWorked + OVERTIME_RATE * overTime)
                  );

              }
              ...
          }

Where did the constants TENTHS_PER_WEEK and OVERTIME_RATE
come from? They might have come from class Employee; so let's take a
look at that:

Click here to view code image

          public abstract class Employee implements PayrollConstants {
              public abstract boolean isPayday();
              public abstract Money calculatePay();
              public abstract void deliverPay(Money pay);

          }

Nope, not there. But then where? Look closely at class Employee. It
implements PayrollConstants.

Click here to view code image

          public interface PayrollConstants {
              public static final int TENTHS_PER_WEEK = 400;
              public static final double OVERTIME_RATE = 1.5;

          }

This is a hideous practice! The constants are hidden at the top of the
inheritance hierarchy. Ick! Don't use inheritance as a way to cheat the
scoping rules of the language. Use a static import instead.

Click here to view code image

          import static PayrollConstants.*;
          public class HourlyEmployee extends Employee {
              private int tenthsWorked;
              private double hourlyRate;

              public Money calculatePay() {
                  int straightTime = Math.min(tenthsWorked,

     TENTHS_PER_WEEK);
                  int overTime = tenthsWorked - straightTime;
                  return new Money(
                     hourlyRate * (tenthsWorked + OVERTIME_RATE * overTime)
                  );

              }
              ...
          }

J3: Constants versus Enums

Now that enums have been added to the language (Java 5), use them! Don't
keep using the old trick of public static final ints. The
meaning of ints can get lost. The meaning of enums cannot, because they
belong to an enumeration that is named.

What's more, study the syntax for enums carefully. They can have methods
and fields. This makes them very powerful tools that allow much more
expression and flexibility than ints. Consider this variation on the payroll
code:

Click here to view code image

          public class HourlyEmployee extends Employee {
              private int tenthsWorked;
              HourlyPayGrade grade;

              public Money calculatePay() {
                  int straightTime = Math.min(tenthsWorked,

     TENTHS_PER_WEEK);
                  int overTime = tenthsWorked - straightTime;
                  return new Money(
                     grade.rate() * (tenthsWorked + OVERTIME_RATE *

     overTime)
                  );

              }
              ...
          }
          public enum HourlyPayGrade {
              APPRENTICE {

                  public double rate() {
                     return 1.0;
       }
   },
   LEUTENANT_JOURNEYMAN {

       public double rate() {
          return 1.2;

       }
   },
   JOURNEYMAN {

       public double rate() {
          return 1.5;

       }
   },
   MASTER {

       public double rate() {
          return 2.0;

       }
   };

   public abstract double rate();
}
Names

N1: Choose Descriptive Names

Don't be too quick to choose a name. Make sure the name is descriptive.
Remember that meanings tend to drift as software evolves, so frequently
reevaluate the appropriateness of the names you choose.

This is not just a "feel-good" recommendation. Names in software are 90
percent of what make software readable. You need to take the time to
choose them wisely and keep them relevant. Names are too important to
treat carelessly.

Consider the code below. What does it do? If I show you the code with
well-chosen names, it will make perfect sense to you, but like this it's just a
hodge-podge of symbols and magic numbers.

Click here to view code image

          public int x() {
                  int q = 0;
                  int z = 0;
                  for (int kk = 0; kk < 10; kk++) {
                     if (l[z] == 10)
                     {
                         q += 10 + (l[z + 1] + l[z + 2]);
                         z += 1;
                     }
                     else if (l[z] + l[z + 1] == 10)
                     {
                         q += 10 + l[z + 2];
                         z += 2;
                     } else {
                         q += l[z] + l[z + 1];
                         z += 2;
                     }
                  }
                  return q;

              }

Here is the code the way it should be written. This snippet is actually less
complete than the one above. Yet you can infer immediately what it is
trying to do, and you could very likely write the missing functions based on
that inferred meaning. The magic numbers are no longer magic, and the
structure of the algorithm is compellingly descriptive.
Click here to view code image

          public int score() {
              int score = 0;
              int frame = 0;
              for (int frameNumber = 0; frameNumber < 10; frameNumber++)

     {
                  if (isStrike(frame)) {
                     score += 10 + nextTwoBallsForStrike(frame);
                     frame += 1;
                  } else if (isSpare(frame)) {
                     score += 10 + nextBallForSpare(frame);
                     frame += 2;
                  } else {
                     score += twoBallsInFrame(frame);
                     frame += 2;
                  }

              }
              return score;
          }

The power of carefully chosen names is that they overload the structure of
the code with description. That overloading sets the readers' expectations
about what the other functions in the module do. You can infer the
implementation of isStrike() by looking at the code above. When you
read the isStrike method, it will be "pretty much what you expected."13

13. See Ward Cunningham's quote on page 11.

Click here to view code image

          private boolean isStrike(int frame) {
              return rolls[frame] == 10;

          }

N2: Choose Names at the Appropriate Level of Abstraction

Don't pick names that communicate implementation; choose names the
reflect the level of abstraction of the class or function you are working in.
This is hard to do. Again, people are just too good at mixing levels of
abstractions. Each time you make a pass over your code, you will likely
find some variable that is named at too low a level. You should take the
opportunity to change those names when you find them. Making code
readable requires a dedication to continuous improvement. Consider the
Modem interface below:

Click here to view code image
          public interface Modem {
              boolean dial(String phoneNumber);
              boolean disconnect();
              boolean send(char c);
              char recv();
              String getConnectedPhoneNumber();

          }

At first this looks fine. The functions all seem appropriate. Indeed, for many
applications they are. But now consider an application in which some
modems aren't connected by dialling. Rather they are connected
permanently by hard wiring them together (think of the cable modems that
provide Internet access to most homes nowadays). Perhaps some are
connected by sending a port number to a switch over a USB connection.
Clearly the notion of phone numbers is at the wrong level of abstraction. A
better naming strategy for this scenario might be:

Click here to view code image

          public interface Modem {
              boolean connect(String connectionLocator);
              boolean disconnect();
              boolean send(char c);
              char recv();
              String getConnectedLocator();

          }

Now the names don't make any commitments about phone numbers. They
can still be used for phone numbers, or they could be used for any other
kind of connection strategy.

N3: Use Standard Nomenclature Where Possible

Names are easier to understand if they are based on existing convention or
usage. For example, if you are using the DECORATOR pattern, you should use
the word Decorator in the names of the decorating classes. For example,
AutoHangupModemDecorator might be the name of a class that
decorates a Modem with the ability to automatically hang up at the end of a
session.

Patterns are just one kind of standard. In Java, for example, functions that
convert objects to string representations are often named toString. It is
better to follow conventions like these than to invent your own.
Teams will often invent their own standard system of names for a particular
project. Eric Evans refers to this as a ubiquitous language for the project.14
Your code should use the terms from this language extensively. In short, the
more you can use names that are overloaded with special meanings that are
relevant to your project, the easier it will be for readers to know what your
code is talking about.

14. [DDD].

N4: Unambiguous Names

Choose names that make the workings of a function or variable
unambiguous. Consider this example from FitNesse:

Click here to view code image

private String doRename()   throws  Exception
{

   if(refactorReferences)
       renameReferences();

   renamePage();

   pathToRename.removeNameFromEnd();
   pathToRename.addNameToEnd(newName);
   return PathParser.render(pathToRename);
}

The name of this function does not say what the function does except in
broad and vague terms. This is emphasized by the fact that there is a
function named renamePage inside the function named doRename!
What do the names tell you about the difference between the two functions?
Nothing.

A better name for that function is
renamePageAndOptionallyAllReferences. This may seem long,
and it is, but it's only called from one place in the module, so it's
explanatory value outweighs the length.

N5: Use Long Names for Long Scopes

The length of a name should be related to the length of the scope. You can
use very short variable names for tiny scopes, but for big scopes you should
use longer names.
Variable names like i and j are just fine if their scope is five lines long.
Consider this snippet from the old standard "Bowling Game":

Click here to view code image

          private void rollMany(int n, int pins)
          {

              for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
                  g.roll(pins);

          }

This is perfectly clear and would be obfuscated if the variable i were
replaced with something annoying like rollCount. On the other hand,
variables and functions with short names lose their meaning over long
distances. So the longer the scope of the name, the longer and more precise
the name should be.

N6: Avoid Encodings

Names should not be encoded with type or scope information. Prefixes such
as m_ or f are useless in today's environments. Also project and/or
subsystem encodings such as vis_ (for visual imaging system) are
distracting and redundant. Again, today's environments provide all that
information without having to mangle the names. Keep your names free of
Hungarian pollution.

N7: Names Should Describe Side-Effects

Names should describe everything that a function, variable, or class is or
does. Don't hide side effects with a name. Don't use a simple verb to
describe a function that does more than just that simple action. For
example, consider this code from TestNG:

Click here to view code image

          public ObjectOutputStream getOos() throws IOException {
              if (m_oos == null) {
                  m_oos = new

     ObjectOutputStream(m_socket.getOutputStream());
              }
              return m_oos;

          }

This function does a bit more than get an "oos"; it creates the "oos" if it
hasn't been created already. Thus, a better name might be
createOrReturnOos.
Tests

T1: Insufficient Tests

How many tests should be in a test suite? Unfortunately, the metric many
programmers use is "That seems like enough." A test suite should test
everything that could possibly break. The tests are insufficient so long as
there are conditions that have not been explored by the tests or calculations
that have not been validated.

T2: Use a Coverage Tool!

Coverage tools reports gaps in your testing strategy. They make it easy to
find modules, classes, and functions that are insufficiently tested. Most
IDEs give you a visual indication, marking lines that are covered in green
and those that are uncovered in red. This makes it quick and easy to find if
or catch statements whose bodies haven't been checked.

T3: Don't Skip Trivial Tests

They are easy to write and their documentary value is higher than the cost
to produce them.

T4: An Ignored Test Is a Question about an Ambiguity

Sometimes we are uncertain about a behavioral detail because the
requirements are unclear. We can express our question about the
requirements as a test that is commented out, or as a test that annotated with
@Ignore. Which you choose depends upon whether the ambiguity is
about something that would compile or not.

T5: Test Boundary Conditions

Take special care to test boundary conditions. We often get the middle of an
algorithm right but misjudge the boundaries.

T6: Exhaustively Test Near Bugs
Bugs tend to congregate. When you find a bug in a function, it is wise to do
an exhaustive test of that function. You'll probably find that the bug was not
alone.

T7: Patterns of Failure Are Revealing

Sometimes you can diagnose a problem by finding patterns in the way the
test cases fail. This is another argument for making the test cases as
complete as possible. Complete test cases, ordered in a reasonable way,
expose patterns.

As a simple example, suppose you noticed that all tests with an input larger
than five characters failed? Or what if any test that passed a negative
number into the second argument of a function failed? Sometimes just
seeing the pattern of red and green on the test report is enough to spark the
"Aha!" that leads to the solution. Look back at page 267 to see an
interesting example of this in the SerialDate example.

T8: Test Coverage Patterns Can Be Revealing

Looking at the code that is or is not executed by the passing tests gives
clues to why the failing tests fail.

T9: Tests Should Be Fast

A slow test is a test that won't get run. When things get tight, it's the slow
tests that will be dropped from the suite. So do what you must to keep your
tests fast.
Conclusion

This list of heuristics and smells could hardly be said to be complete.
Indeed, I'm not sure that such a list can ever be complete. But perhaps
completeness should not be the goal, because what this list does do is imply
a value system.

Indeed, that value system has been the goal, and the topic, of this book.
Clean code is not written by following a set of rules. You don't become a
software craftsman by learning a list of heuristics. Professionalism and
craftsmanship come from values that drive disciplines.

Appendix A
Concurrency II

                                                    by Brett L. Schuchert
This appendix supports and amplifies the Concurrency chapter on page 177.
It is written as a series of independent topics and you can generally read
them in any order. There is some duplication between sections to allow for
such reading.
Client/Server Example

Imagine a simple client/server application. A server sits and waits listening
on a socket for a client to connect. A client connects and sends a request.

The Server

Here is a simplified version of a server application. Full source for this
example is available starting on page 343, Client/Server Nonthreaded.

Click here to view code image

          ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8009);

while (keepProcessing) {
       try {
              Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
              process(socket);
       } catch (Exception e) {
              handle(e);
       }

}

This simple application waits for a connection, processes an incoming
message, and then again waits for the next client request to come in. Here's
client code that connects to this server:

Click here to view code image

     private void connectSendReceive(int i) {                PORT);
            try {
                    Socket socket = new Socket("localhost",
                    MessageUtils.sendMessage(socket,

Integer.toString(i));
                    MessageUtils.getMessage(socket);
                    socket.close();

            } catch (Exception e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();

            }
     }

How well does this client/server pair perform? How can we formally
describe that performance? Here's a test that asserts that the performance is
"acceptable":

Click here to view code image
          @Test(timeout = 10000)
          public void shouldRunInUnder10Seconds() throws Exception {

                   Thread[] threads = createThreads();
                   startAllThreadsw(threads);
                   waitForAllThreadsToFinish(threads);
          }

The setup is left out to keep the example simple (see
"ClientTest.java" on page 344). This test asserts that it should
complete within 10,000 milliseconds.

This is a classic example of validating the throughput of a system. This
system should complete a series of client requests in ten seconds. So long as
the server can process each individual client request in time, the test will
pass.

What happens if the test fails? Short of developing some kind of event
polling loop, there is not much to do within a single thread that will make
this code any faster. Will using multiple threads solve the problem? It
might, but we need to know where the time is being spent. There are two
possibilities:

   � I/O--using a socket, connecting to a database, waiting for virtual
      memory swapping, and so on.

   � Processor--numerical calculations, regular expression processing,
      garbage collection, and so on.

Systems typically have some of each, but for a given operation one tends to
dominate. If the code is processor bound, more processing hardware can
improve throughput, making our test pass. But there are only so many CPU
cycles available, so adding threads to a processor-bound problem will not
make it go faster.

On the other hand, if the process is I/O bound, then concurrency can
increase efficiency. When one part of the system is waiting for I/O, another
part can use that wait time to process something else, making more
effective use of the available CPU.

Adding Threading

Assume for the moment that the performance test fails. How can we
improve the throughput so that the performance test passes? If the
process method of the server is I/O bound, then here is one way to make
the server use threads (just change the processMessage):

Click here to view code image

          void process(final Socket socket) {
                  if (socket == null)
                         return;

            Runnable clientHandler = new Runnable() {               "Processed:
                    public void run() {
                           try {
                                  String message =

MessageUtils.getMessage(socket);
                                  MessageUtils.sendMessage(socket,

" + message);
                                  closeIgnoringException(socket);

                           } catch (Exception e) {
                                  e.printStackTrace();

                           }
                    }
            };

       Thread clientConnection = new Thread(clientHandler);
       clientConnection.start();
}

Assume that this change causes the test to pass;1 the code is complete,
correct?

1. You can verify that for yourself by trying out the before and after code. Review the nonthreaded
code starting on page 343. Review the threaded code starting on page 346.

Server Observations

The updated server completes the test successfully in just over one second.
Unfortunately, this solution is a bit naive and introduces some new
problems.

How many threads might our server create? The code sets no limit, so the
we could feasibly hit the limit imposed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
For many simple systems this may suffice. But what if the system is meant
to support many users on the public net? If too many users connect at the
same time, the system might grind to a halt.

But set the behavioral problem aside for the moment. The solution shown
has problems of cleanliness and structure. How many responsibilities does
the server code have?

   � Socket connection management

   � Client processing

   � Threading policy

   � Server shutdown policy

Unfortunately, all these responsibilities live in the process function. In
addition, the code crosses many different levels of abstraction. So, small as
the process function is, it needs to be repartitioned.

The server has several reasons to change; therefore it violates the Single
Responsibility Principle. To keep concurrent systems clean, thread
management should be kept to a few, well-controlled places. What's more,
any code that manages threads should do nothing other than thread
management. Why? If for no other reason than that tracking down
concurrency issues is hard enough without having to unwind other
nonconcurrency issues at the same time.

If we create a separate class for each of the responsibilities listed above,
including the thread management responsibility, then when we change the
thread management strategy, the change will impact less overall code and
will not pollute the other responsibilities. This also makes it much easier to
test all the other responsibilities without having to worry about threading.
Here is an updated version that does just that:

Click here to view code image

          public void run() {
              while (keepProcessing) {
                try {
                  ClientConnection clientConnection =

     connectionManager.awaitClient();
                  ClientRequestProcessor requestProcessor
                     = new ClientRequestProcessor(clientConnection);
                  clientScheduler.schedule(requestProcessor);
                  } catch (Exception e) {
                     e.printStackTrace();
                  }

              }
              connectionManager.shutdown();
          }
This now focuses all things thread-related into one place,
clientScheduler. If there are concurrency problems, there is just one
place to look:

Click here to view code image

          public interface ClientScheduler {
                  void schedule(ClientRequestProcessor requestProcessor);

          }

The current policy is easy to implement:

Click here to view code image

          public class ThreadPerRequestScheduler implements
     ClientScheduler {

                  public void schedule(final ClientRequestProcessor
     requestProcessor) {

                         Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
                                public void run() {
                                       requestProcessor.process();
                                }

                         };

                       Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
                       thread.start();
                  }
          }

Having isolated all the thread management into a single place, it is much
easier to change the way we control threads. For example, moving to the
Java 5 Executor framework involves writing a new class and plugging it in
(Listing A-1).

Listing A-1 ExecutorClientScheduler.java

Click here to view code image

          import java.util.concurrent.Executor;
          import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

          public class ExecutorClientScheduler implements
     ClientScheduler {

                  Executor executor;

                  public ExecutorClientScheduler(int availableThreads) {
                         executor =

     Executors.newFixedThreadPool(availableThreads);
                   }
                  public void schedule(final ClientRequestProcessor
     requestProcessor) {

                         Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
                                public void run() {
                                       requestProcessor.process();
                                }

                         };
                         executor.execute(runnable);
                   }
          }

Conclusion

Introducing concurrency in this particular example demonstrates a way to
improve the throughput of a system and one way of validating that
throughput through a testing framework. Focusing all concurrency code
into a small number of classes is an example of applying the Single
Responsibility Principle. In the case of concurrent programming, this
becomes especially important because of its complexity.
Possible Paths of Execution

Review the method incrementValue, a one-line Java method with no
looping or branching:

Click here to view code image

          public class IdGenerator {
              int lastIdUsed;

              public int incrementValue() {
                  return ++lastIdUsed;

              }
          }

Ignore integer overflow and assume that only one thread has access to a
single instance of IdGenerator. In this case there is a single path of
execution and a single guaranteed result:

   � The value returned is equal to the value of lastIdUsed, both of
      which are one greater than just before calling the method.

What happens if we use two threads and leave the method unchanged?
What are the possible outcomes if each thread calls incrementValue
once? How many possible paths of execution are there? First, the outcomes
(assume lastIdUsed starts with a value of 93):

   � Thread 1 gets the value of 94, thread 2 gets the value of 95, and
      lastIdUsed is now 95.

   � Thread 1 gets the value of 95, thread 2 gets the value of 94, and
      lastIdUsed is now 95.

   � Thread 1 gets the value of 94, thread 2 gets the value of 94, and
      lastIdUsed is now 94.

The final result, while surprising, is possible. To see how these different
results are possible, we need to understand the number of possible paths of
execution and how the Java Virtual Machine executes them.

Number of Paths
To calculate the number of possible execution paths, we'll start with the
generated byte-code. The one line of java (return ++lastIdUsed;)
becomes eight byte-code instructions. It is possible for the two threads to
interleave the execution of these eight instructions the way a card dealer
interleaves cards as he shuffles a deck.2 Even with only eight cards in each
hand, there are a remarkable number of shuffled outcomes.

2. This is a bit of a simplification. However, for the purpose of this discussion, we can use this
simplifying model.

For this simple case of N instructions in a sequence, no looping or
conditionals, and T threads, the total number of possible execution paths is
equal to

                       Calculating the Possible Orderings

  This comes from an email from Uncle Bob to Brett:
  With N steps and T threads there are T* N total steps. Prior to each step there is a context switch
  that chooses between the T threads. Each path can thus be represented as a string of digits
  denoting the context switches. Given steps A and B and threads 1 and 2, the six possible paths are
  1122, 1212, 1221, 2112, 2121, and 2211. Or, in terms of steps it is A1B1A2B2, A1A2B1B2,
  A1A2B2B1, A2A1B1B2, A2A1B2B1, and A2B2A1B1. For three threads the sequence is
  112233, 112323, 113223, 113232, 112233, 121233, 121323, 121332, 123132, 123123, ....
  One characteristic of these strings is that there must always be N instances of each T. So the
  string 111111 is invalid because it has six instances of 1 and zero instances of 2 and 3.
  So we want the permutations of N 1's, N 2's, ... and N T's. This is really just the permutations of
  N* T things taken N* T at a time, which is (N* T)!, but with all the duplicates removed. So the
  trick is to count the duplicates and subtract that from (N* T)!.
  Given two steps and two threads, how many duplicates are there? Each four-digit string has two
  1s and two 2s. Each of those pairs could be swapped without changing the sense of the string.
  You could swap the 1s or the 2s both, or neither. So there are four isomorphs for each string,
  which means that there are three duplicates. So three out of four of the options are duplicates;
  alternatively one of four of the permutations are NOT duplicates. 4! * .25 = 6. So this reasoning
  seems to work.
  How many duplicates are there? In the case where N = 2 and T = 2, I could swap the 1s, the 2s, or
  both. In the case where N = 2 and T = 3, I could swap the 1s, the 2s, the 3s, 1s and 2s, 1s and 3s,
  or 2s and 3s. Swapping is just the permutations of N. Let's say there are P permutations of N. The
  number of different ways to arrange those permutations are P**T.
  So the number of possible isomorphs is N!**T. And so the number of paths is (T*N)!/(N!**T).
  Again, in our T = 2, N = 2 case we get 6 (24/4).
  For N = 2 and T = 3 we get 720/8 = 90.
  For N = 3 and T = 3 we get 9!/6^3 = 1680.
For our simple case of one line of Java code, which equates to eight lines of
byte-code and two threads, the total number of possible paths of execution
is 12,870. If the type of lastIdUsed is a long, then every read/write
becomes two operations instead of one, and the number of possible
orderings becomes 2,704,156.

What happens if we make one change to this method?

Click here to view code image

          public synchronized void incrementValue() {
                  ++lastIdUsed;

          }

The number of possible execution pathways becomes two for two threads
and N! in the general case.

Digging Deeper

What about the surprising result that two threads could both call the method
once (before we added synchronized) and get the same numeric result?
How is that possible? First things first.

What is an atomic operation? We can define an atomic operation as any
operation that is uninterruptable. For example, in the following code, line 5,
where 0 is assigned to lastid, is atomic because according to the Java
Memory model, assignment to a 32-bit value is uninterruptable.

Click here to view code image

01: public class Example {

02: int lastId;

03:

04: public void resetId() {

05:             value = 0;

06: }

07:

08: public int getNextId() {

09:             ++value;

10: }

11:}

What happens if we change type of lastId from int to long? Is line 5
still atomic? Not according to the JVM specification. It could be atomic on
a particular processor, but according to the JVM specification, assignment
to any 64-bit value requires two 32-bit assignments. This means that
between the first 32-bit assignment and the second 32-bit assignment, some
other thread could sneak in and change one of the values.

What about the pre-increment operator, ++, on line 9? The pre-increment
operator can be interrupted, so it is not atomic. To understand, let's review
the byte-code of both of these methods in detail.

Before we go any further, here are three definitions that will be important:

   � Frame--Every method invocation requires a frame. The frame includes
      the return address, any parameters passed into the method and the local
      variables defined in the method. This is a standard technique used to
      define a call stack, which is used by modern languages to allow for
      basic function/method invocation and to allow for recursive
      invocation.

   � Local variable--Any variables defined in the scope of the method. All
      nonstatic methods have at least one variable, this, which represents
      the current object, the object that received the most recent message (in
      the current thread), which caused the method invocation.

   � Operand stack--Many of the instructions in the Java Virtual Machine
      take parameters. The operand stack is where those parameters are put.
      The stack is a standard last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure.

Here is the byte-code generated for resetId():
These three instructions are guaranteed to be atomic because, although the
thread executing them could be interrupted after any one of them, the
information for the PUTFIELD instruction (the constant value 0 on the top
of the stack and the reference to this one below the top, along with the
field value) cannot be touched by another thread. So when the assignment
occurs, we are guaranteed that the value 0 will be stored in the field value.
The operation is atomic. The operands all deal with information local to the
method, so there is no interference between multiple threads.

So if these three instructions are executed by ten threads, there are
4.38679733629e+24 possible orderings. However, there is only one
possible outcome, so the different orderings are irrelevant. It just so
happens that the same outcome is guaranteed for longs in this case as well.
Why? All ten threads are assigning a constant value. Even if they interleave
with each other, the end result is the same.

With the ++ operation in the getNextId method, there are going to be
problems. Assume that lastId holds 42 at the beginning of this method.
Here is the byte-code for this new method:
Imagine the case where the first thread completes the first three
instructions, up to and including GETFIELD, and then it is interrupted. A
second thread takes over and performs the entire method, incrementing
lastId by one; it gets 43 back. Then the first thread picks up where it left
off; 42 is still on the operand stack because that was the value of lastId
when it executed GETFIELD. It adds one to get 43 again and stores the
result. The value 43 is returned to the first thread as well. The result is that
one of the increments is lost because the first thread stepped on the second
thread after the second thread interrupted the first thread.

Making the getNexId() method synchronized fixes this problem.

Conclusion

An intimate understanding of byte-code is not necessary to understand how
threads can step on each other. If you can understand this one example, it
should demonstrate the possibility of multiple threads stepping on each
other, which is enough knowledge.

That being said, what this trivial example demonstrates is a need to
understand the memory model enough to know what is and is not safe. It is
a common misconception that the ++ (pre- or post-increment) operator is
atomic, and it clearly is not. This means you need to know:

   � The code that can cause concurrent read/update issues
   � How to guard such concurrent issues from happening
Knowing Your Library

Executor Framework

As demonstrated in the ExecutorClientScheduler.java on page
321, the Executor framework introduced in Java 5 allows for
sophisticated execution using thread pools. This is a class in the
java.util.concurrent package.

If you are creating threads and are not using a thread pool or are using a
hand-written one, you should consider using the Executor. It will make
your code cleaner, easier to follow, and smaller.

The Executor framework will pool threads, resize automatically, and
recreate threads if necessary. It also supports futures, a common concurrent
programming construct. The Executor framework works with classes
that implement Runnable and also works with classes that implement the
Callable interface. A Callable looks like a Runnable, but it can
return a result, which is a common need in multithreaded solutions.

A future is handy when code needs to execute multiple, independent
operations and wait for both to finish:

Click here to view code image

          public String processRequest(String message) throws Exception
     {

                  Callable<String> makeExternalCall = new Callable<String>
     () {

                         public String call() throws Exception {
                                String result = "";
                                // make external request
                                return result;

                         }
                  };

                  Future<String> result =
     executorService.submit(makeExternalCall);

                  String partialResult = doSomeLocalProcessing();
                  return result.get() + partialResult;
          }
In this example, the method starts executing the makeExternalCall
object. The method continues other processing. The final line calls
result.get(), which blocks until the future completes.

Nonblocking Solutions

The Java 5 VM takes advantage of modern processor design, which
supports reliable, nonblocking updates. Consider, for example, a class that
uses synchronization (and therefore blocking) to provide a thread-safe
update of a value:

Click here to view code image

          public class ObjectWithValue {
                  private int value;
                  public void synchronized incrementValue() { ++value; }
                  public int getValue() { return value; }

          }

Java 5 has a series of new classes for situations like this:
AtomicBoolean, AtomicInteger, and AtomicReference are
three examples; there are several more. We can rewrite the above code to
use a nonblocking approach as follows:

Click here to view code image

          public class ObjectWithValue {
                  private AtomicInteger value = new AtomicInteger(0);

                  public void incrementValue() {
                  value.incrementAndGet();
                  }
                  public int getValue() {

                         return value.get();
                  }
          }

Even though this uses an object instead of a primitive and sends messages
like incrementAndGet() instead of ++, the performance of this class
will nearly always beat the previous version. In some cases it will only be
slightly faster, but the cases where it will be slower are virtually
nonexistent.

How is this possible? Modern processors have an operation typically called
Compare and Swap (CAS). This operation is analogous to optimistic
locking in databases, whereas the synchronized version is analogous to
pessimistic locking.

The synchronized keyword always acquires a lock, even when a
second thread is not trying to update the same value. Even though the
performance of intrinsic locks has improved from version to version, they
are still costly.

The nonblocking version starts with the assumption that multiple threads
generally do not modify the same value often enough that a problem will
arise. Instead, it efficiently detects whether such a situation has occurred
and retries until the update happens successfully. This detection is almost
always less costly than acquiring a lock, even in moderate to high
contention situations.

How does the Virtual Machine accomplish this? The CAS operation is
atomic. Logically, the CAS operation looks something like the following:

Click here to view code image

          int variableBeingSet;

          void simulateNonBlockingSet(int newValue) {
                  int currentValue;
                  do {
                       currentValue = variableBeingSet
                  } while(currentValue != compareAndSwap(currentValue,

     newValue));
          }

          int synchronized compareAndSwap(int currentValue, int
     newValue) {

                  if(variableBeingSet == currentValue) {
                         variableBeingSet = newValue;
                         return currentValue;

                  }
                  return variableBeingSet;
          }

When a method attempts to update a shared variable, the CAS operation
verifies that the variable getting set still has the last known value. If so, then
the variable is changed. If not, then the variable is not set because another
thread managed to get in the way. The method making the attempt (using
the CAS operation) sees that the change was not made and retries.
Nonthread-Safe Classes

There are some classes that are inherently not thread safe. Here are a few
examples:

   � SimpleDateFormat

   � Database Connections

   � Containers in java.util

   � Servlets

Note that some collection classes have individual methods that are threadsafe. However, any operation that involves calling more than one method is
not. For example, if you do not want to replace something in a
HashTable because it is already there, you might write the following
code:

Click here to view code image

          if(!hashTable.containsKey(someKey)) {
                  hashTable.put(someKey, new SomeValue());

          }

Each individual method is thread-safe. However, another thread might add a
value in between the containsKey and put calls. There are several
options to fix this problem.

   � Lock the HashTable first, and make sure all other users of the
      HashTable do the same--client-based locking:

          synchronized(map) {
          if(!map.conainsKey(key))

                  map.put(key, value);
          }

   � Wrap the HashTable in its own object and use a different API--
      server-based locking using an ADAPTER:

Click here to view code image

          public class WrappedHashtable<K, V> {
                  private Map<K, V> map = new Hashtable<K, V>();

                  public synchronized void putIfAbsent(K key, V value) {
                         if (map.containsKey(key))
                                map.put(key, value);
                  }
          }

   � Use the thread-safe collections:

Click here to view code image

          ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, String> map = new
     ConcurrentHashMap<Integer,

          String>();
          map.putIfAbsent(key, value);

The collections in java.util.concurrent have operations like
putIfAbsent() to accommodate such operations.
Dependencies Between Methods Can Break Concurrent Code

Here is a trivial example of a way to introduce dependencies between
methods:

Click here to view code image

          public class IntegerIterator implements Iterator<Integer>
                  private Integer nextValue = 0;

                  public synchronized boolean hasNext() {
                         return nextValue < 100000;

                  }
                  public synchronized Integer next() {

                         if (nextValue == 100000)
                                throw new IteratorPastEndException();

                         return nextValue++;
                  }
                  public synchronized Integer getNextValue() {

                         return nextValue;
                  }
          }

Here is some code to use this IntegerIterator:

Click here to view code image

          IntegerIterator iterator = new IntegerIterator();
          while(iterator.hasNext()) {

                int nextValue = iterator.next();
                // do something with nextValue
          }

If one thread executes this code, there will be no problem. But what
happens if two threads attempt to share a single instance of
IngeterIterator with the intent that each thread will process the
values it gets, but that each element of the list is processed only once? Most
of the time, nothing bad happens; the threads happily share the list,
processing the elements they are given by the iterator and stopping when
the iterator is complete. However, there is a small chance that, at the end of
the iteration, the two threads will interfere with each other and cause one
thread to go beyond the end of the iterator and throw an exception.

Here's the problem: Thread 1 asks the question hasNext(), which returns
true. Thread 1 gets preempted and then Thread 2 asks the same question,
which is still true. Thread 2 then calls next(), which returns a value as
expected but has a side effect of making hasNext() return false.
Thread 1 starts up again, thinking hasNext() is still true, and then calls
next(). Even though the individual methods are synchronized, the client
uses two methods.

This is a real problem and an example of the kinds of problems that crop up
in concurrent code. In this particular situation this problem is especially
subtle because the only time where this causes a fault is when it happens
during the final iteration of the iterator. If the threads happen to break just
right, then one of the threads could go beyond the end of the iterator. This is
the kind of bug that happens long after a system has been in production, and
it is hard to track down.

You have three options:

   � Tolerate the failure.

   � Solve the problem by changing the client: client-based locking

   � Solve the problem by changing the server, which additionally changes
      the client: server-based locking

Tolerate the Failure

Sometimes you can set things up such that the failure causes no harm. For
example, the above client could catch the exception and clean up. Frankly,
this is a bit sloppy. It's rather like cleaning up memory leaks by rebooting at
midnight.

Client-Based Locking

To make IntegerIterator work correctly with multiple threads,
change this client (and every other client) as follows:

Click here to view code image

          IntegerIterator iterator = new IntegerIterator();

                  while (true) {
                     int nextValue;

              synchronized (iterator) {
                  if (!iterator.hasNext())
                     break;
                  nextValue = iterator.next();
              }
              doSometingWith(nextValue);
          }

Each client introduces a lock via the synchronized keyword. This
duplication violates the DRY principle, but it might be necessary if the code
uses non-thread-safe third-party tools.

This strategy is risky because all programmers who use the server must
remember to lock it before using it and unlock it when done. Many (many!)
years ago I worked on a system that employed client-based locking on a
shared resource. The resource was used in hundreds of different places
throughout the code. One poor programmer forgot to lock the resource in
one of those places.

The system was a multi-terminal time-sharing system running accounting
software for Local 705 of the trucker's union. The computer was in a
raised-floor, environment-controlled room 50 miles north of the Local 705
headquarters. At the headquarters they had dozens of data entry clerks
typing union dues postings into the terminals. The terminals were connected
to the computer using dedicated phone lines and 600bps half-duplex
modems. (This was a very, very long time ago.)

About once per day, one of the terminals would "lock up." There was no
rhyme or reason to it. The lock up showed no preference for particular
terminals or particular times. It was as though there were someone rolling
dice choosing the time and terminal to lock up. Sometimes more than one
terminal would lock up. Sometimes days would go by without any lock-ups.

At first the only solution was a reboot. But reboots were tough to
coordinate. We had to call the headquarters and get everyone to finish what
they were doing on all the terminals. Then we could shut down and restart.
If someone was doing something important that took an hour or two, the
locked up terminal simply had to stay locked up.

After a few weeks of debugging we found that the cause was a ring-buffer
counter that had gotten out of sync with its pointer. This buffer controlled
output to the terminal. The pointer value indicated that the buffer was
empty, but the counter said it was full. Because it was empty, there was
nothing to display; but because it was also full, nothing could be added to
the buffer to be displayed on the screen.

So we knew why the terminals were locking, but we didn't know why the
ring buffer was getting out of sync. So we added a hack to work around the
problem. It was possible to read the front panel switches on the computer.
(This was a very, very, very long time ago.) We wrote a little trap function
that detected when one of these switches was thrown and then looked for a
ring buffer that was both empty and full. If one was found, it reset that
buffer to empty. Voila! The locked-up terminal(s) started displaying again.

So now we didn't have to reboot the system when a terminal locked up. The
Local would simply call us and tell us we had a lock-up, and then we just
walked into the computer room and flicked a switch.

Of course sometimes they worked on the weekends, and we didn't. So we
added a function to the scheduler that checked all the ring buffers once per
minute and reset any that were both empty and full. This caused the
displays to unclog before the Local could even get on the phone.

It was several more weeks of poring over page after page of monolithic
assembly language code before we found the culprit. We had done the math
and calculated that the frequency of the lock-ups was consistent with a
single unprotected use of the ring buffer. So all we had to do was find that
one faulty usage. Unfortunately, this was so very long ago that we didn't
have search tools or cross references or any other kind of automated help.
We simply had to pore over listings.

I learned an important lesson that cold Chicago winter of 1971. Clientbased locking really blows.

Server-Based Locking

The duplication can be removed by making the following changes to
IntegerIterator:

Click here to view code image

          public class IntegerIteratorServerLocked {
                  private Integer nextValue = 0;
                  public synchronized Integer getNextOrNull() {
                         if (nextValue < 100000)
                                return nextValue++;
                         else
                              return null;

                  }
          }

And the client code changes as well:

Click here to view code image

          while (true) {
                  Integer nextValue = iterator.getNextOrNull();
                  if (next == null)
                         break;
                  // do something with nextValue

          }

In this case we actually change the API of our class to be multithread
aware.3 The client needs to perform a null check instead of checking
hasNext().

3. In fact, the Iterator interface is inherently not thread-safe. It was never designed to be used by
multiple threads, so this should come as no surprise.

In general you should prefer server-based locking for these reasons:

   � It reduces repeated code--Client-based locking forces each client to
      lock the server properly. By putting the locking code into the server,
      clients are free to use the object and not worry about writing additional
      locking code.

   � It allows for better performance--You can swap out a thread-safe
      server for a non-thread safe one in the case of single-threaded
      deployment, thereby avoiding all overhead.

   � It reduces the possibility of error--All it takes is for one programmer
      to forget to lock properly.

   � It enforces a single policy--The policy is in one place, the server,
      rather than many places, each client.

   � It reduces the scope of the shared variables--The client is not aware of
      them or how they are locked. All of that is hidden in the server. When
      things break, the number of places to look is smaller.

 What if you do not own the server code?

   � Use an ADAPTER to change the API and add locking

          public class ThreadSafeIntegerIterator {
                  private IntegerIterator iterator = new IntegerIterator();

                  public synchronized Integer getNextOrNull() {
                         if(iterator.hasNext())
                                return iterator.next();
                         return null;

                  }
          }

Increasing Throughput

Let's assume that we want to go out on the net and read the contents of a set
of pages from a list of URLs. As each page is read, we will parse it to
accumulate some statistics. Once all the pages are read, we will print a
summary report.

The following class returns the contents of one page, given a URL.

Click here to view code image

          public class PageReader {
              //...
              public String getPageFor(String url) {
                  HttpMethod method = new GetMethod(url);

                  try {
                     httpClient.executeMethod(method);
                     String response = method.getResponseBodyAsString();
                     return response;

                  } catch (Exception e) {
                     handle(e);

                  } finally {
                     method.releaseConnection();

                  }
              }
          }

The next class is the iterator that provides the contents of the pages based
on an iterator of URLs:

Click here to view code image

          public class PageIterator {
              private PageReader reader;
              private URLIterator urls;

              public PageIterator(PageReader reader, URLIterator urls) {
                  this.urls = urls;
                  this.reader = reader;

              }

              public synchronized String getNextPageOrNull() {
                  if (urls.hasNext())
                     getPageFor(urls.next());
                  else
                     return null;

              }
              public String getPageFor(String url) {
                  return reader.getPageFor(url);

              }
          }

An instance of the PageIterator can be shared between many different
threads, each one using it's own instance of the PageReader to read and
parse the pages it gets from the iterator.
Notice that we've kept the synchronized block very small. It contains
just the critical section deep inside the PageIterator. It is always better
to synchronize as little as possible as opposed to synchronizing as much as
possible.

Single-Thread Calculation of Throughput
Now lets do some simple calculations. For the purpose of argument, assume
the following:

   � I/O time to retrieve a page (average): 1 second
   � Processing time to parse page (average): .5 seconds
   � I/O requires 0 percent of the CPU while processing requires 100

      percent.
For N pages being processed by a single thread, the total execution time is
1.5 seconds * N. Figure A-1 shows a snapshot of 13 pages or about 19.5
seconds.

Figure A-1 Single thread

Multithread Calculation of Throughput
If it is possible to retrieve pages in any order and process the pages
independently, then it is possible to use multiple threads to increase
throughput. What happens if we use three threads? How many pages can we
acquire in the same time?

As you can see in Figure A-2, the multithreaded solution allows the
process-bound parsing of the pages to overlap with the I/O-bound reading
of the pages. In an idealized world this means that the processor is fully
utilized. Each one-second page read is overlapped with two parses. Thus,
we can process two pages per second, which is three times the throughput
of the single-threaded solution.

Figure A-2 Three concurrent threads
Deadlock

Imagine a Web application with two shared resource pools of some finite
size:

   � A pool of database connections for local work in process storage

   � A pool of MQ connections to a master repository

      Assume there are two operations in this application, create and update:

   � Create--Acquire connection to master repository and database. Talk to
      service master repository and then store work in local work in process
      database.

   � Update--Acquire connection to database and then master repository.
      Read from work in process database and then send to the master
      repository

What happens when there are more users than the pool sizes? Consider each
pool has a size of ten.

   � Ten users attempt to use create, so all ten database connections are
      acquired, and each thread is interrupted after acquiring a database
      connection but before acquiring a connection to the master repository.

   � Ten users attempt to use update, so all ten master repository
      connections are acquired, and each thread is interrupted after acquiring
      the master repository but before acquiring a database connection.

   � Now the ten "create" threads must wait to acquire a master repository
      connection, but the ten "update" threads must wait to acquire a
      database connection.

   � Deadlock. The system never recovers.

This might sound like an unlikely situation, but who wants a system that
freezes solid every other week? Who wants to debug a system with
symptoms that are so difficult to reproduce? This is the kind of problem that
happens in the field, then takes weeks to solve.

A typical "solution" is to introduce debugging statements to find out what is
happening. Of course, the debug statements change the code enough so that
the deadlock happens in a different situation and takes months to again
occur.4

4. For example, someone adds some debugging output and the problem "disappears." The debugging
code "fixes" the problem so it remains in the system.

To really solve the problem of deadlock, we need to understand what causes
it. There are four conditions required for deadlock to occur:

   � Mutual exclusion
   � Lock & wait
   � No preemption
   � Circular wait

Mutual Exclusion

Mutual exclusion occurs when multiple threads need to use the same
resources and those resources

   � Cannot be used by multiple threads at the same time.
   � Are limited in number.
A common example of such a resource is a database connection, a file open
for write, a record lock, or a semaphore.

Lock & Wait

Once a thread acquires a resource, it will not release the resource until it has
acquired all of the other resources it requires and has completed its work.

No Preemption

One thread cannot take resources away from another thread. Once a thread
holds a resource, the only way for another thread to get it is for the holding
thread to release it.

Circular Wait

This is also referred to as the deadly embrace. Imagine two threads, T1 and
T2, and two resources, R1 and R2. T1 has R1, T2 has R2. T1 also requires
R2, and T2 also requires R1. This gives something like Figure A-3:
Figure A-3

All four of these conditions must hold for deadlock to be possible. Break
any one of these conditions and deadlock is not possible.

Breaking Mutual Exclusion
One strategy for avoiding deadlock is to sidestep the mutual exclusion
condition. You might be able to do this by

   � Using resources that allow simultaneous use, for example,
      AtomicInteger.

   � Increasing the number of resources such that it equals or exceeds the
      number of competing threads.

   � Checking that all your resources are free before seizing any.
Unfortunately, most resources are limited in number and don't allow
simultaneous use. And it's not uncommon for the identity of the second
resource to be predicated on the results of operating on the first. But don't
be discouraged; there are three conditions left.

Breaking Lock & Wait
You can also eliminate deadlock if you refuse to wait. Check each resource
before you seize it, and release all resources and start over if you run into
one that's busy.
This approach introduces several potential problems:

   � Starvation--One thread keeps being unable to acquire the resources it
      needs (maybe it has a unique combination of resources that seldom all
      become available).
   � Livelock--Several threads might get into lockstep and all acquire one
      resource and then release one resource, over and over again. This is
      especially likely with simplistic CPU scheduling algorithms (think
      embedded devices or simplistic hand-written thread balancing
      algorithms).

Both of these can cause poor throughput. The first results in low CPU
utilization, whereas the second results in high and useless CPU utilization.

As inefficient as this strategy sounds, it's better than nothing. It has the
benefit that it can almost always be implemented if all else fails.

Breaking Preemption

Another strategy for avoiding deadlock is to allow threads to take resources
away from other threads. This is usually done through a simple request
mechanism. When a thread discovers that a resource is busy, it asks the
owner to release it. If the owner is also waiting for some other resource, it
releases them all and starts over.

This is similar to the previous approach but has the benefit that a thread is
allowed to wait for a resource. This decreases the number of startovers. Be
warned, however, that managing all those requests can be tricky.

Breaking Circular Wait

This is the most common approach to preventing deadlock. For most
systems it requires no more than a simple convention agreed to by all
parties.

In the example above with Thread 1 wanting both Resource 1 and Resource
2 and Thread 2 wanting both Resource 2 and then Resource 1, simply
forcing both Thread 1 and Thread 2 to allocate resources in the same order
makes circular wait impossible.

More generally, if all threads can agree on a global ordering of resources
and if they all allocate resources in that order, then deadlock is impossible.
Like all the other strategies, this can cause problems:

   � The order of acquisition might not correspond to the order of use; thus
      a resource acquired at the start might not be used until the end. This
      can cause resources to be locked longer than strictly necessary.
   � Sometimes you cannot impose an order on the acquisition of resources.
      If the ID of the second resource comes from an operation performed
      on the first, then ordering is not feasible.

So there are many ways to avoid deadlock. Some lead to starvation,
whereas others make heavy use of the CPU and reduce responsiveness.

5. There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.

Isolating the thread-related part of your solution to allow for tuning and
experimentation is a powerful way to gain the insights needed to determine
the best strategies.
Testing Multithreaded Code

How can we write a test to demonstrate the following code is broken?

Click here to view code image

01: public class ClassWithThreadingProblem {

02: int nextId;

03:

04: public int takeNextId() {

05:          return nextId++;

06: }

07:}

Here's a description of a test that will prove the code is broken:

� Remember the current value of nextId.

� Create two threads, both of which call takeNextId() once.

� Verify that nextId is two more than what we started with.

� Run this until we demonstrate that nextId was only incremented by
  one instead of two.

Listing A-2 shows such a test:

34:

35:             fail("Should have exposed a threading issue but

it did not.");

36:    }

37: }
This test certainly sets up the conditions for a concurrent update problem.
However, the problem occurs so infrequently that the vast majority of times
this test won't detect it.

Indeed, to truly detect the problem we need to set the number of iterations
to over one million. Even then, in ten executions with a loop count of
1,000,000, the problem occurred only once. That means we probably ought
to set the iteration count to well over one hundred million to get reliable
failures. How long are we prepared to wait?

Even if we tuned the test to get reliable failures on one machine, we'll
probably have to retune the test with different values to demonstrate the
failure on another machine, operating system, or version of the JVM.

And this is a simple problem. If we cannot demonstrate broken code easily
with this problem, how will we ever detect truly complex problems?

So what approaches can we take to demonstrate this simple failure? And,
more importantly, how can we write tests that will demonstrate failures in
more complex code? How will we be able to discover if our code has
failures when we do not know where to look?

Here are a few ideas:

   � Monte Carlo Testing. Make tests flexible, so they can be tuned. Then
      run the test over and over--say on a test server--randomly changing
      the tuning values. If the tests ever fail, the code is broken. Make sure
      to start writing those tests early so a continuous integration server
      starts running them soon. By the way, make sure you carefully log the
      conditions under which the test failed.

   � Run the test on every one of the target deployment platforms.
      Repeatedly. Continuously. The longer the tests run without failure, the
      more likely that

     - The production code is correct or

     - The tests aren't adequate to expose problems.

   � Run the tests on a machine with varying loads. If you can simulate
      loads close to a production environment, do so.

Yet, even if you do all of these things, you still don't stand a very good
chance of finding threading problems with your code. The most insidious
problems are the ones that have such a small cross section that they only
occur once in a billion opportunities. Such problems are the terror of
complex systems.
Tool Support for Testing Thread-Based Code

IBM has created a tool called ConTest.6 It instruments classes to make it
more likely that non-thread-safe code fails.

6. http://www.haifa.ibm.com/projects/verification/contest/index.html

We do not have any direct relationship with IBM or the team that developed
ConTest. A colleague of ours pointed us to it. We noticed vast improvement
in our ability to find threading issues after a few minutes of using it.

Here's an outline of how to use ConTest:

   � Write tests and production code, making sure there are tests specifically
      designed to simulate multiple users under varying loads, as mentioned
      above.

   � Instrument test and production code with ConTest.

   � Run the tests.

When we instrumented code with ConTest, our success rate went from
roughly one failure in ten million iterations to roughly one failure in thirty
iterations. Here are the loop values for several runs of the test after
instrumentation: 13, 23, 0, 54, 16, 14, 6, 69, 107, 49, 2. So clearly the
instrumented classes failed much earlier and with much greater reliability.
Conclusion

This chapter has been a very brief sojourn through the large and treacherous
territory of concurrent programming. We barely scratched the surface. Our
emphasis here was on disciplines to help keep concurrent code clean, but
there is much more you should learn if you are going to be writing
concurrent systems. We recommend you start with Doug Lea's wonderful
book Concurrent Programming in Java: Design Principles and Patterns.7

7. See [Lea99] p. 191.

In this chapter we talked about concurrent update, and the disciplines of
clean synchronization and locking that can prevent it. We talked about how
threads can enhance the throughput of an I/O-bound system and showed the
clean techniques for achieving such improvements. We talked about
deadlock and the disciplines for preventing it in a clean way. Finally, we
talked about strategies for exposing concurrent problems by instrumenting
your code.

Epilogue

In 2005, while attending the Agile conference in Denver, Elisabeth
Hedrickson1 handed me a green wrist band similar to the kind that Lance
Armstrong made so popular. This one said "Test Obsessed" on it. I gladly
put it on and wore it proudly. Since learning TDD from Kent Beck in 1999,
I have indeed become obsessed with test-driven development.

1. http://www.qualitytree.com/

But then something strange happened. I found I could not take the band off.
Not because it was physically stuck, but because it was morally stuck. The
band made an overt statement about my professional ethics. It was a visible
indication of my commitment to writing the best code I could write. Taking
it off seemed like a betrayal of those ethics and of that commitment.

So it is on my wrist still. When I write code, I see it there in my peripheral
vision. It is a constant reminder of the promise I made to myself to write
clean code.
